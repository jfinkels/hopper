      <description>&lt;P&gt;Traditionally founded by Herakles, Abdera was in fact a 7th century B.C. colony of Klazomenai which was reestablished in the 6th century by Ionians refugees from Teos. It fell under Persian control in 490 B.C. and later became a member of the Delian League. Philip II conquered the city in ca. 350 B.C. and in 196 B.C. Rome declared it a free city. The city suffered two major destructions: in 376 B.C. at the hands of the Thracian tribe of the Triballi and in 170 B.C. by a Roman force. Abdera was famed for the beauty of its coinage and as the birthplace of Democritus and Protagoras. Although occupied into the Byzantine period it had lost all political importance during the Roman Imperial period.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;The city had two harbors, the larger one protected by a mole and city fortification walls. The walls extended ca. 5.5 km and enclosed a city designed on the Hippodamian grid system in the 4th century B.C. Houses of the Hellenistic and Roman period survive, as do the theater, Roman baths and a terracotta figurine workshop. Byzantine fortifications have obscured earlier remains on the acropolis.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;In 431 B.C. the Spartans under King Archidamos occupied the site and used it as a base from which to ravage the Attic countryside. In 404 B.C. the forces of the Thirty Tyrants also used the deme site as a base.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;Acharnai was the largest of the Attic deme sites and known to have been located 60 stades from Athens. Although its exact position remains uncertain, it is believed to have been S of Mt. Parnes, in the area of the modern village of Menidi (where inscriptions with Acharnaian names have been found). Ancient sources refer to sanctuaries of Apollo Argyieus and Herakles and a temple of Ares and Athena Areia at the site, but no trace of these remains have been found.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Aegina is located in a key maritime position and since prehistoric times has had close trade contact with the mainland and the islands. It may have been depopulated in the Dark Ages and then resettled by colonists from the Peloponnese in the 10th century B.C. By the end of the 8th century, however, Aegina was independent of any mainland ties. During the 7th and 6th centuries, Aegina was a major maritime power and had trade contacts from Egypt to Spain. The island was especially noted for its fine pottery and bronze products. Aegina was apparently the first Greek city state to adopt coinage and its system of weights became one of the earliest standards for trade in the Greek historical period.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;During the 6th century B.C. the growing power of Athens came into conflict with the interests of Aegina. Although Aegina fought along side the Greeks at Salamis, conflict with Athens continued and in 458 B.C. Athens defeated the combined navies of Aegina and Corinth. In 431 B.C. Athens expelled the inhabitants of Aegina and established an Athenian cleruchy on their territory. In 404 B.C. the remaining Aegina citizens returned from exile, but the city was no longer a major power. Aegina came under Macedonian control and finally in 210 B.C. it passed to the rule of Pergamon.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;The ancient capital of Aegina is located on the NW coast of the island, partially under the modern town. The city had a larger commercial harbor and N of this a rectangular military harbor. The latter was protected on the N by a low promontory which served as the acropolis. The Classical city walls enclosed both harbors and the acropolis promontory.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;On the promontory beneath the levels of the ca. 500 B.C. temple of Apollo and the remains of an earlier temple, excavations have uncovered levels of continuous occupation extending back through the Bronze Ages to the Neolithic. The successive settlements on the acropolis were each fortified, at least since the Early Bronze Age. The 6th century temple of Apollo was replaced by a late Roman fortress.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Although Mycenaean ex-voto offerings and traces of Geometric structures have been found on the site, the earliest definite indication of cult activity dates to the 7th century B.C. At this time, when the Aegina Thalossocracy developed, a small altar and perhaps a structure to house the cult image of Aphaia were enclosed in a sacred temenos.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the 6th century the first temple of Aphaia was constructed and a 2nd altar was set up between the temple and the original altar. A southern gateway or propylon was also added to the temenos.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;During the third and final major building phase, early in the 5th century, a new and larger temple was constructed with a slightly different orientation. The area of the sacred precinct was tripled in size and a ramp was built from the temple to the altar, which was also enlarged. A new propylon was also added and priests' quarters were built to the S in an adjoining enclosure.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;Aigosthena is at a sheltered bay at the E end of the Gulf of Corinth. The site commanded the ancient route from Boeotia to the Peloponnese. It was never of great importance in antiquity and was mentioned by only one ancient writer, Xenophon in 378 B.C.

      <description>&lt;P&gt;The earliest evidence for settlement at Akrotiri dates to the Early Bronze Age II and III periods. The pottery and artifacts of this phase show connections to the N Aegean islands.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the Middle Bronze Age the size of the settlement expands and artifacts now show closer connections with Mainland Greece. The 1st Minoan influence is also seen at the site in this period. The transition from Middle Bronze Age to Late Bronze Age passes with no cultural break, but was marred by an earthquake (at ca. 1550 B.C.) which caused great damage to the settlement. The inhabitants apparently rebuilt their city immediately and in an even more luxurious and larger scale.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The size of the Late Bronze Age I settlement is estimated to have been several thousand inhabitants. The wealth and size of the city, with paved streets, city sewer system, and 2 and 3 story private houses with magnificent wall paintings, indoor toilets and rich furnishings certainly equalled or surpassed the level of culture and wealth on Minoan Crete. The settlement at Akrotiri probably gained this high degree of wealth and culture through its foreign contacts and its position in the center of the Aegean trade networks.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At ca. 1500 B.C. earthquake tremors again caused damage to the city. There is evidence that immediately afterwards the inhabitants began again to clean up debris and repair the damage. Before the repairs were completed, however, the inhabitants were forewarned (possibly from gas or smoke from the volcano) of the coming eruption (no human remains or valuables have been found during the excavations). The eruption buried Akrotiri under 5 m of ash and pumice. At least 200 years passed before the island of Thera was again inhabited, and there is no evidence for a settlement on the island again until the Archaic period.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
      <exploration>&lt;P&gt;Exploration began in 1845 and systematic excavations were carried out 1895-1903, then resumed after WWII under S. Marinatos and up to present under C. Doumas.&lt;/P&gt;</exploration>
      <periods>&lt;P&gt;Middle Bronze Age&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Late Bronze Age&lt;/P&gt;</periods>
      <physical>&lt;P&gt;The site of Akrotiri is located in the SW of the island of Thera, above a sheltered S facing bay and with a view to Crete, ca. 110 km to the S. The Bronze Age settlement (over 10,000 sq m) was at the zenith of its development when it was completely buried by ash and pumice following a volcanic eruption (dated at ca. 1500 B.C.) that has been estimated as 4 times as powerful as the Krakatoa eruption of 1883 A.D. The extensive architectural remains and well preserved wall paintings have led to a comparison with Roman Pompeii. The destruction may have given rise to the Atlantis myth.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;The cult of Amphiaraos (a mythical Argive hero and seer) was established in the 5th century B.C. and its popularity continued to grow through the Classical and Roman periods. The sanctuary was well known for the divinations of its oracle, the interpretation of dreams and a place where pilgrims were healed. The festival of Amphiaraos was celebrated every 4 years and was especially popular in the Roman period.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Although control of the territory of Oropos was constantly contested between Athens and Boeotia, the sanctuary seems to have remained inviolated until it was finally abandoned in the 4th century A.D.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;In 437 B.C. Agnon defeated the local Edonians and established Amphipolis as an Athenian colony. The mixed population surrendered easily to Sparta in 424 B.C., but Athens retained control of its port city of Eion. Despite repeated efforts by the Athenians, Amphipolis remained autonomous until 357 B.C. when it was conquered by Philip II. During Alexander's campaign to Asia in 334 B.C., the city used as a naval base and Alexander's 3 most celebrated admirals were natives of Amphipolis. In the Hellenistic period it was the location of one of the royal mints. Rome conquered the city in 168 B.C. Prosperity continued through the Roman period and the international Via Egnatia passed through the city. During the Byzantine period the city was called Popolia and a large number of rich churches were constructed. The city was probably destroyed in the 9th century A.D. Slavic invasions.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;Amphipolis is W of Kavalla, ca. 4 km N of the coast on the bank of the Strymon river. It was built on a commanding plateau 154 m above the river which curves around below the W half of the city walls. The fortification walls extend in a circuit of ca. 7 km and there is an inner acropolis wall of ca. 2 km. Excavations have uncovered domestic buildings of the Hellenistic and Roman periods, a Roman stoa and a number of Byzantine basilicas, but the agora, temples, and other structures of the Classical period remain to be discovered. Outside the walls 2 sanctuaries and a large number graves have been discovered.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;The site was first settled in the Aceramic Neolithic and continued to be occupied throughout the Neolithic and Bronze Ages. The mound served as the acropolis of Mycenaean Argissa and Classical Argyra. The Classical city spread to the plateau below. Two concentric fortification walls (the inner wall dating perhaps to the Archaic period) encircled the Hellenistic city.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Although tradition states that Agamemnon was elected at the Heraion to lead the Trojan expedition, the earliest finds at the cult area date to the Geometric period. The sanctuary grew and expended during the Archaic and Classical period and most of the remains (with the exception of the Roman baths and palaestra) date to the 7th through 5th centuries B.C. The sanctuary continued in importance through the Roman period.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;The Heraion is located approximately equidistant from Argos and Mycenae, in an area referred to by Pausanias as Prosymna. The sanctuary occupies 3 artificial terraces below Mt. Euboea and has a commanding view of the Argive plain. The upper terrace, supported by a retaining wall of possible late Geometric date, is a level paved area occupied by the Old Temple and an altar. The later, middle terrace supports the New Temple, where a chryselephantine statue of Hera by Polykleitos was housed. Other structures located on this terrace included one of the earliest examples of a building with a peristyle court, which may have served as a banquet hall. On the lowest terrace is a stoa and an Archaic step-like retaining wall. To the W are Roman baths and palaestra.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Traditionally Argos was claimed as one of the oldest cities of ancient Greece, and the birthplace of Perseus, the son of Danae and Zeus. Some Neolithic remains have been found in the area, but the best evidence for early occupation is the Early to Middle Helladic settlement on the summit of Aspis. By Mycenaean times the center of settlement had moved to the higher Larissa hill to the W (where the Frankish castle now stands).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Although Argos was a major Mycenaean center and its citizens figure prominently in the Homeric epics, the city was over-shadowed by nearby Mycenae. After the fall of the Mycenaean Empire Argos seems to have had the predominant role in the Peloponnese until the 6th century B.C. when it begins a long struggle with Sparta. Throughout the Classical period Argos allied itself with Corinth or Athens against Sparta. In 229 B.C. Argos joined the Achaean League and after 146 B.C. it became part of the Roman province of Achaea. Substantial Roman building activity indicates prosperity in the 1st to 5th centuries A.D.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Argos was capital of King Pheidon and home of sculptors Ageladas and Polykleitos.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
      <exploration>&lt;P&gt;In 1892, I. Kophiniotis partially excavated the theater; between 1902 and 1930 W. Vollgraff carried out several excavations on behalf of the French School. French School excavations have continued under the direction of G. Daux and P. Courbin since 1952.&lt;/P&gt;</exploration>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;Argos lies ca. 7 km inland, near the center of the 200 square km Argive plain, and between the bases of the Aspis and Larissa hills and the Kharadros river. The W half of the modern town of Argos covers the ancient city and excavations have been limited to small areas and rescue work. Features that have been excavated or investigated include the theater, agora, sanctuary of Apollo and Athena, the Roman odeion and baths, and sections of the Classical circuit wall.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;The acropolis of Assos was occupied in the Bronze Age, but first began to expand in the 8th and 7th centuries B.C. when Aeolian colonists from Methymna on Lesbos replaced the Carian inhabitants.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the 6th century B.C. the city fell under Lydian and then Persian domination until it acquired independence when, following the Persian Wars, it became a member of the Delian League.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The oldest extant architectural remains of the city date to the mid 6th century B.C. and include the Doric temple of Athena on the acropolis, traces of domestic buildings, and sections of fortification walls.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The impressive and well preserved fortification walls at Assos are ca. 5 km in circumference with many square and round towers, 2 major gateways and 7 smaller gates. The walls, which date to the mid 4th century enclosed a large area to the N of the acropolis and all of the civic establishments (gymnasium, theater, agora and stoas, bouleuterion) of the lower town, S of the acropolis and extending down to the shore. The acropolis was separately fortified and the city's S walls protected the 2 small artificial harbors. At the harbors were facilities to transport ships overland in order to avoid the rough seas off the Troad. From the city's main NW gate a broad paved road lead through the principal necropolis to a 4th century B.C. stone bridge at the Satnioeis River, ca. 1 km to the N.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Assos reached its peak of fame in the 4th century B.C. In 365 B.C., under the banker-ruler Eubulus, it defended against a combined land and sea attack launched by the Persian satrap Autophradates and King Mausolus of Halicarnassus. In ca. 355-340 B.C., Hermias, the former eunuch-slave of Eubulus, ruled Assos and invited his former fellow students from Plato's Academy (including Aristotle, Xenocrates, Callisthenes, and Theophrastus) to join him in founding a philosophical school at Assos. The city became, for a short period, one of the main centers of culture in the Greek world. this came to an end in 341 B.C. when Hermias was captured and executed by the Persians.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After the death of Alexander, Assos fell under the control of the Seleucids, then Pergamon, and finally in 133 B.C. Rome. The city suffered commercial competition from Alexander Troas, but continued to prosper through the Roman period. Later, its fortifications served to deter Gaul and barbarian attacks.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;The natural defenses of the Acropolis, with fresh water springs at its base and a vista of the plain and distant coast, was a focus for prehistoric settlement, and by the Late Bronze Age a Mycenaean citadel occupied the summit. This citadel was one of the few Mycenaean centers to survive the upheavals and destruction of the later 13th century B.C. and may have served as a refuge for those fleeing other parts of the collapsing empire. According to tradition, Theseus, the king of Athens at this time (or somewhat later) unified the towns of Attica in the synoecism (amalgamation) and founded the first city-state of Athens.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Although the city does not seem to have had a circuit wall until the 6th century B.C. (when it was built by Solon or Peisistratos), the 13th century citadel continued to serve the city and, in fact, these defenses were still in use at the time of the Persian invasion in 480 B.C. The Acropolis began its transformation into a purely religious area in 566 B.C. when Peisistratos instituted the festival and games of the Great Panathenaia and the great ramp and 1st temples were built on the Acropolis. Religious constructions, although interrupted by the Persian invasion, continued from the 6th century through the Roman period. Numerous sanctuaries, shrines and other buildings of religious character were established on the Acropolis slopes (where prior to the 6th century, habitations, shops, and cemeteries had been located).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Agora of Theseus' time was located on the NW slope of the Acropolis while the later Agora of Solon was placed to the N of the Areopagus. In the mid 6th century the Agora shifted to its 3rd and final location.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After the Persian destruction of Athens and the Acropolis in 480 B.C., major rebuilding began under the archonship of Themistocles. A new and much extended wall was built around the city and the fortification of the Piraeus which had been initiated in 493 B.C. were completed. Under the rule of Pericles in the 5th century, the masterworks of the classical age were created on the Acropolis, and in the lower city. The Athenian city walls were destroyed by the Spartans in 404 B.C., but again rebuilt by Konon in 394 B.C.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In 86 B.C. the walls of Athens and Piraeus were demolished by Sulla and the city remained unwalled until the time of Valerian (253-260 A.D.). The new walls included the new city which had been built by Hadrian. Valerian also re fortified the Acropolis.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In spite of Valerian's fortifications of the city, Athens suffered a devastation by the Herulians in 267 A.D. After the Herulian destruction a smaller circuit wall (known as the Late Roman Wall) was built to the N of the Acropolis. The outer ancient circuit wall was repaired in Justinian's time and in use up to 1204 A.D.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In 529 A.D. Justinian closed the internationally famous philosophical schools of Athens, but it retained its reputation as an intellectual center throughout the Byzantine period.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;Located in the center of a large plain, enclosed on all but S side by mountains, Athens is ca. 7 km inland from its seaport at Piraeus. The site has been continuously inhabited from Neolithic times to the present. The plateau and the slopes of the Acropolis hill were the area of earliest settlement and later became the religious center of the ancient city. S of the Acropolis, in the Ilissos district, were many sanctuaries and athletic establishments. N of the Acropolis is the Agora, the civic and social center of the ancient city and N of the Agora is the Kerameikos (the potters' quarter), the Sacred Gate (opening toward Eleusis) and, beyond the city walls, the cemetery. W of the Acropolis are the hills of the Areopagus (site of the most ancient court of Athens), the Pnyx (meeting place of the popular assembly), and the Hills of the Muses and the Nymphs. The NW quarter of the city was occupied by artisans and tradesmen and farther W the Long Walls linked Athens to the harbor city of Piraeus.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <site_type>Sanctuary</site_type>
      <description>&lt;P&gt;Earlier habitation and cemetery remains of Neolithic to Late Bronze Age date have been found SE of the sanctuary, but the cult site appears to date no earlier than the 8th century B.C. According to myth, the rites and cult statue of Artemis (who was particularly connected with childbirth and was worshipped chiefly by women) were brought to Attica from Scythia (Crimea) by Iphigeneia and Orestes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The sacred spring at Brauron seems to have been originally the most sacred part of the sanctuary, and the first temple was erected as late as ca. 500 B.C. Both were probably destroyed by the Persians in 480 B.C. when a wooden image (perhaps the original cult statue) was reportedly carried off to Susa. About 10 m SE of the temple was a small building, perhaps representing the supposed tomb of Iphigeneia. This seems to have replaced an earlier building to the SE which was destroyed with the collapse of the sacred cave at mid 5th century. The later stoa at the sanctuary had a number of dinning rooms perhaps used by the Arktoi servant girls of Artemis Brauronia.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Offerings (of feminine character) recovered from the sanctuary, especially from the sacred spring, have helped to clarify aspects of the cult.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The site was finally abandoned after the nearby river Erasinos flooded the sanctuary in the 3rd century B.C. There was no activity at the sanctuary in the Roman period, but building material from it was reused in a 6th century A.D. Christian basilica ca 500 m W of the sanctuary site.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;On the coast ca. 38 km E of Athens, the sanctuary consists of a cave and sacred spring and a court enclosed by a temple and a three-winged stoa. The stoa housed the votive dedications and numerous dinning rooms. Inscriptions mention other buildings including a palaestra and gymnasium which have not been excavated. Ritual included dancing by &quot;Arktoi,&quot; girls aged 5 to 10 dressed as bears. Iphigeneia is said to have brought the cult statue of Artemis here and to be buried here.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;The earliest known human occupation of the island dates to the Mesolithic period, but according to ancient authors the inhabitants were barbarians until Corinth established a colony there in 734 B.C. The colony was placed on the E coast of the island, where a small group of Euboean merchants had already founded a maritime way station.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Corcyra prospered and soon began to form colonies of its own; leading to a conflict with the mother city in 664 B.C. and the first recorded sea battle between Greek city-states. New conflicts between Corcyra and Corinth in 435-431 B.C. brought Athens to the aid of Corcyra and precipitated the Peloponnesian War. During the following 2 centuries the island's alliance passed from Athens to Sparta to Epirus.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Corcyra came under Roman control in 229 B.C. and served as a major naval base. The city was abandoned after destruction by the Goths in the 6th century A.D. and was used as a quarry for the later city to the N.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;Corcyra, second largest of the Ionian Islands, is at the NW extreme of Greek territory, ca. 3 km W of the coast of Albania. It is a fertile and well-watered island and a natural stopover for sea traffic between Greece and Italy.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The ancient city of Corcyra (just S of the modern city) was established by Corinthian colonists on a large hook-shaped peninsula at the center of the sheltered E coast. The peninsula encloses a lagoon (the ancient Hyllaian Harbor) that could be closed by a chain. The fortified ancient city spanned the peninsula from the lagoon on the W to the bay of Garitsa (ancient Alkinoos, the 2nd port of Corcyra) on the E, and extended to the highland in the S, to the acropolis (at the present village of Analipsis).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Archaic Temple of Artemis sat on the lower N slopes of the acropolis hill. Other Archaic and Classical sanctuaries and remains have been located on the peninsula, but much of the ancient city has been quarried for stone to build the Medieval city and fortresses to the N.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;The name Korinthos is pre-Greek and the site was occupied from the Early Neolithic through the Early Bronze Age. There is little evidence for settlement in the Middle and Late Bronze Ages, however, when the region of the Corinthia is overshadowed by the neighboring Argolid.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Traditionally, Corinth was founded by the Dorians. During the 7th and 6th centuries B.C. it became a leading mercantile and colonizing power. Pottery and bronzes manufactured in Archaic Corinth were traded as far as Spain, Egypt and the Black Sea. After the Persian Wars, the rise of Athens weakened Corinth's overseas contacts and power and Corinth is frequently aligned with Sparta against Athens during the Classical period.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The defeat of the Greek forces at Chaironeia (338 B.C.) resulted in a Macedonian garrison being placed at Corinth and the city became the meeting place for the Macedonian controlled Hellenic League. Corinth flourished under Macedonian rule, but revolted in 224 B.C. to join the renewed Achaean League. In 146 B.C. the League was defeated by Rome and Corinth was completely destroyed by the Roman general Mummius.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The city remained virtually abandoned until Julius Caesar established a colony of veterans on the site in 44 B.C. It became the capital of the Roman province of Achaia in 27 B.C. Extensive rebuilding in the 1st century A.D. included the addition of a forum, large public baths, and an amphitheater. Under Roman patronage Corinth soon reclaimed and exceeded its earlier reputation as the Greek city most noted for luxury, vice, and decadence.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Corinth suffered and survived barbarian destruction in the 3rd and 4th centuries and disastrous earthquakes in the 6th century A.D. Its steady decline in prosperity was finally completed by the sack of the city by the Crusaders in the 12th century.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;Ancient Corinth is strategically located 10 km SW of the Isthmus of Corinth and 3 km inland from its port of Lechaion, on the gulf of Corinth. The harbor town of Kenchreai, 10 km to the E, provided the city with access to the Saronic gulf. Corinth controlled the N-S land traffic over the Isthmus and maintained the Diolkos, a stone paved portage for ships crossing the Isthmus.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Corinth was linked to Lechaion in the 5th century B.C. by parallel Long Walls (cf. Athens and Piraeus) which enclosed a large area of urban and agricultural land as well as numerous sanctuaries. To the S, walls extended from Corinth and ascended to the natural strong hold on the heights of Acrocorinth. The large fortress on Acrocorinth, with its triple line of fortifications and supply of spring water was almost impregnable and a key (throughout history) to the control of the Peloponnese.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Within the fortifications of Corinth itself (an area over twice the size of Classical Athens) religious, civic, commercial and domestic buildings as well as a large number of markets, factories and taverns crowded around the centrally placed Temple of Apollo. Most of the remains visible today date to the rebuilding and embellishment of the city during the Roman period.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Evidence for settlement on Delos goes back the Early Bronze Age. In the later prehistoric period it was, according to legend, a stronghold of Carian pirates until they were driven off by King Minos of Crete.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The cult of Apollo appeared on the island in the Dark Ages and by the Archaic period (when the island was apparently under the control of Naxos), Delos served as the headquarters and religious center of an Ionian League. A religious festival (the Delia) was held (originally every year) to celebrate the birth of Apollo.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Athens, a member of the Ionian League, gained control over the sanctuary and under Peisistratos (ca. 543 B.C.) instigated the first purification of the island (the removal of all tombs in view of the temple). In 490 B.C. the Delians fled to Tenos, but the Persians did not violate the sanctuary.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Delos was made the center of the Athenian controlled Delian League (the alliance of Greek states against future Persian threat) and from 478-454 maintained the treasury of the league (until it was transferred to Athens and partially misappropriated for the rebuilding of the Acropolis). In 426 Athens reorganized the site and festival on an even larger scale and ordered the second purification of the island (the dead were exhumed and removed and a decree passed against birth, death, and pain on the island). In 422 Athens banished the remaining Delians from the island (on the intervention of the Delphic oracle they were allowed to return). Every year Athens sent a sacred embassy by trireme to the Delia festival. At the end of the Peloponnesian War Sparta restored independence to the Delians, but at the time of the 2nd Athenian League (378-314 B.C.) Athens again controlled the sanctuary and island.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Delos is again independent from ca. 314 until 166 B.C. It becomes the center of an island confederacy and enters the most prosperous period of its history. The Hellenistic kings provided many new buildings and offerings for the sanctuary, which was now under the control of 4 Hieropes (priest-administrators) elected annually by the Delians. The financial and trading activities of the island grew while foreign merchants and bankers, especially Roman, settled and installed sanctuaries to foreign deities on the island. In 166 B.C. the Delians were expelled and Rome allowed Athenians to occupy the island. Delos was made a free port (to undermine the commercial position of Rhodes) and in 146 B.C. the destruction of Corinth and the immigration of Corinthian merchants to Delos added to the island's growth. The religious aspects of the island gave way to commercial interests and the Apollo festival became essentially an international trade fair, with as many as 10,000 slaves changing hands in a single day.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In 88 B.C. Menophanes, a general of Mithradates attacked the island, killed or enslaved the population, looted the sanctuary and destroyed the city. In 87 B.C. Sulla retook the island, returned it to Athenian control and aided in its rebuilding. In 69 B.C. Delos was sacked by pirates, and in 66 B.C. the Romans built a fortification wall around the city. The sanctuary and the commercial center, however, continued to decline (in part because of changes in Roman trade routes) and suffer pirate attacks, and by the 2nd century A.D. it was all but abandoned. In the 3rd century A.D. Athens offered the island for sale, but found no buyers.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;The sanctuary occupies a small (1.3 x 5 km) island at the center (between Rheneia and Mykonos) of the Cycladic group and was the political and religious center of the Aegean.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It was said to be the birthplace of Apollo and Artemis. Its oracle was second only to that of Delphi. Delian Festival and Games held every 4 years. In addition to the Hieron of Apollo adjacent to the Sacred Lake, the temples and monuments to other divinities and the sanctuary of foreign gods, there was also a thriving residential district and maritime quarter to the south.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Archaeological excavation has shown that a Mycenaean cult center existed at Delphi under the later temenos of Athena Pronaia, but there is no clear evidence for continuity into the 8th century B.C. nor for the identity of the original deity. Tradition and myth, however, report that the site at Delphi, originally called Pytho, was first sacred to Poseidon and Ge (Mother Earth) and that an oracle presided near a cave inhabited by Python, the serpent son of Ge.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the 8th century B.C. the cult of Pythian Apollo developed and shortly thereafter, according to tradition, priests arrived from Knossos and introduced the cult of Apollo Delphinios (dolphin) which effected the sanctuary's change in name.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the 8th and 7th centuries the sanctuary prospered, in large part, because the oracle played an important role in advising the Greek cities on colonization ventures. Numerous buildings, including the first ashlar temple of Apollo, were added to the sanctuary and dedications and wealth accumulated. The fame of the Delphic oracle spread throughout the civilized world.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In 600-586 B.C. the 1st Sacred War resulted in the control of the sanctuary being passed to the Amphictyonic League (a federation of 12 city states, including Athens and Sparta). The Amphictyony reorganized and presided over the Pythian Games (previously instituted in honor of Apollo, Artemis, and Leto, and 1 of the 4 major games-festivals of the Greeks). The games were now held every 4 years instead of every 8, and the chariot race was added.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The 8th century temple of Apollo which had been destroyed by fire was rebuilt in 548 B.C. and the sanctuary area was enlarged to its present size with funds collected throughout the Mediterranean world. During the 6th century the fame and prosperity of the sanctuary continued to grow.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In 480 B.C. a miraculous landslide halted a Persian raid on the sanctuary. In 373 the temple of Apollo was destroyed by earthquake and again rebuilt with international donations. The 4th century became a 2nd period of architectural enhancement and prosperity for the sanctuary. In 279 B.C. the sanctuary was again miraculously saved from a barbarian (Gauls) pillage. The 3rd century brought additional architectural development at the sanctuary through the contributions of the Pergamon kings.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After the war of 595-586, 3 more Sacred Wars (448, 356, 340 B.C.) were fought among various Greek city-states over the control of the sanctuary and its sacred lands in the Krisaean plain below. Finally in 189 B.C. the Romans replaced the Aetolians as protectors of Delphi and the fortunes of the sanctuary then fluctuated according to the attitudes of the succeeding Roman rulers. The general Sulla plundered the site in 86 B.C. and Nero carried off over 500 bronze statues in 51 A.D., while Hadrian and the Antonines attempted to restore the past glory of the sanctuary. In general, however, the wealth of the sanctuary and the power of the oracle continued to decline under Roman rule and the site suffered its final blow with the edict of Theodosius, ca. 390 A.D.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
      <exploration>&lt;P&gt;Cyriac of Ancona copied inscriptions in 1436; in 1676, the site was rediscovered by Wheler and Spon; preliminary study was carried out by various scholars in the 19th century; excavations: 1892 - present, French School of Archaeology.&lt;/P&gt;</exploration>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;Located in a dramatic setting on S slopes of Mt. Parnassos, Delphi was regarded in antiquity as the center of the world. The recognition of Delphi and the fame of its oracle extended beyond the borders of the Greek world and gave the sanctuary an international standing, whereas the rival sanctuary of Olympia had a more national Greek character. The main temenos of Apollo contained numerous treasuries and monuments. The Sacred Way led through the precinct to the altar and temple of Apollo. Other buildings include a theater, stadium, and bouleuterion. E of Apollo's precinct is the Kastalian Spring and fountainhouse where visitors purified themselves. SE of the spring is the smaller temenos of Athena Pronaia (the so-called Marmaria). The Pythian Games, one of the four great athletic and drama festivals of ancient Greece, was held every 4 years. The Pythia, an elderly priestess of Apollo, was the most famous and respected oracle in the ancient world.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;The site of Dimini covers an area of ca. 5000 sq. m and flourished during the Thessalian Late Neolithic period (ca. 4000 - 3000 B.C.). The earlier Neolithic period is represented at Dimini by only a handful of sherds and the post Neolithic remains consists of a few cist graves of Middle Bronze Age date and the Late Bronze Age tholos tomb.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The architecture of the 2nd phase at Dimini shows the same construction methods and same use of materials as seen at earlier Sesklo. Dimini, however, has a definite fortification system in the form of 6 or 7 concentric circuit walls. Some of these walls were as close together as 1 m and may have been rubble filled double-faced fortress walls. The original number of walls is unknown. They vary in thickness from 0.6 to 1.4 m, were possibly 2 to 3 m in height, and were made of rough stone set in mud. The walls follow the natural contours of the hill and have no corners or towers. At the center and highest part of the oval shaped hill there was an oval courtyard in which a megaron type building and a few smaller buildings stood. Possibly one additional megaron and several additional structures were scattered within the walls.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;Ca. 4 km W of Volos on a low mound, Dimini was discovered when archaeologists were excavating a Mycenaean tholos tomb built into the mound. One megaron-type building in an oval courtyard and sheds or shelters built inside against the yard's wall are enclosed by a series of 6 or 7 fortification ring-walls. Traces of smaller buildings or houses have been found outside the fortifications at the base of the mound.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <site_type>Sanctuary</site_type>
      <description>&lt;P&gt;The sanctuary of Zeus at Dodona, already known in the Homeric epics, was traditionally the home of the earliest oracle in Greece. Early to Late Bronze Age finds have been excavated at the site, but the earliest archaeological evidence for cult activity dates to the 8th century B.C. At this early date the sanctuary consisted of a sacred oak tree (or grove) possibly surrounded by a ring of bronze tripods. At the end of the 5th century B.C. or early in the 4th, the first stone temple was constructed and the sacred oak was enclosed in a stone peribolos wall.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;During the 4th century, the bouleuterion and 3 temples (probably to Aphrodite, Dione, and Themis) were added, and a fortified refuge was constructed above the sanctuary. Beginning with the rule of King Pyrrhos (297-272 B.C.), who promoted the site as a pan-Hellenic sanctuary, Dodona developed a more monumental character. In the 3rd century B.C. the temenos was enlarged and the theater, Temple of Herakles, and stoas were added. In 232 B.C. Dodona became the center of the newly formed Epirote League. The sanctuary was destroyed by the Aetolians in 219 B.C., but was immediately rebuilt by the League and Philip V with spoils taken from the Aetolians. During the 3rd century a stadium with stone seats was also added to the sanctuary.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In 168 B.C. the site was destroyed by the Romans and only slightly repaired before it was again ravaged in 88 B.C. by Mithradates and the Thracians. Although the Naia Festivals and the activities of the oracle continued into the 3rd century A.D., the sanctuary never recovered from the destruction of 168 B.C. and was in a ruinous state already in the 1st century B.C. In the time of Augustus the theater had been converted into an arena and, as at the sanctuary of Artemis Orthia at Sparta, the religious function of the site seems to have been reduced in the Roman period to its tourist appeal. In the 5th or 6th century A.D. a Christian basilica was constructed on the site with reused ancient materials.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Naia Festival (athletic and drama contests) was held every 4 years in honor of Zeus. The earliest attendants were males, the &lt;hi rend=&quot;ital&quot;&gt;selloi&lt;/hi&gt;, but were later replaced by priestesses. The oracular responses seemed to have been originally the oral report on sounds caused by the rustling of leaves, cooing of doves, or the ringing of metal tripods, but by the 6th century B.C. applications and occasionally the oracle's responses were written on lead tablets.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

It developed into a temenos that included several temples, theater, stadium, and a number of stoas. Just above the sanctuary is a refuge acropolis enclosed by fortification walls dating to the 4th century B.C. In the temenos of the sanctuary is a bouleuterion where the delegates of the Epirote League held council.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;The city was founded in the Geometric period and was most prosperous in the 8th - 6th centuries B.C. Above and SW of the agora stood the Temple of Apollo (built ca. 750 B.C.), one of the earliest known Greek temples. In the temple were found early (ca. 650 B.C.) statuettes of Apollo, Leto and Artemis, made of sheet-bronze hammered over wooden cores. Another important early find from Dreros is the group of Archaic inscriptions (found in the fill of a later Hellenistic cistern) that includes the earliest complete record of constitutional law found in Greece. In the 3rd to 2nd centuries B.C. Dreros became first an ally and then a dependent of Knossos. The city lost importance in the 2nd century B.C., but continued to exist into the Byzantine period.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;According to tradition, Mycenaean Eleusis was the home of an early cult of Demeter and one of the 12 Attic cities to unite in the Synoecism formed by Theseus of Athens. Although the association with Demeter is not definite, remains of a Mycenaean shrine have indeed been found under the later sanctuary of the goddess.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the Geometric period (at ca. 750 B.C.) the earliest Telesterion (the building where the mysteries were conducted) was built. At ca. 600 B.C. a larger Telesterion, known as the Solonian was built and the Eleusinian Mysteries became a Panhellenic cult.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the 2nd half of the 6th century B.C., under the influence of Peisistratos and his sons, the size of the sanctuary doubled and new walls and an enlarged Telesterion were constructed. The Peisistratean Telesterion was destroyed during the Persian War. Kimon initiated reconstruction in 470 B.C., but his plans were never completed. The new Telesterion was built during the Periklean age in the 2nd half of the 5th century B.C. and the sanctuary became one of the most renowned in Greece. The fame of the Mysteries spread beyond the Greek borders.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;During the Peloponnesian War (431-404) the sanctuary was respected by the warring states. In the 2nd half of the 4th century the sanctuary of Demeter and the city of Eleusis increased in size to attain its greatest extend.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Roman Emperors favored the sanctuary and the city of Eleusis. When the Kostovoks burned the Telesterion of Perikles in 170 B.C., it was rebuilt and slightly enlarged by Marcus Aurelius. Many Roman officials (including Hadrian in 125 A.D.) were initiated into the Mysteries. The destruction of the sanctuary by the Visigoths in 396 A.D. and the anti-pagan decree of Theodosius ca. 390 A.D. ended religious activity at the sanctuary.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
      <exploration>&lt;P&gt;G. Wheler reported on the site in 1676. In 1811 the Dilettanti Society carried out the first excavation. The Greek Archaeological Society has excavated from 1882 to present.&lt;/P&gt;</exploration>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;The city of Eleusis (birthplace of Aeschylus) is located 22 km W of Athens on a ridge above the bay of Eleusis and at the S side of a large plain. The site has been occupied since the Early Bronze Age and the acropolis fortified at least as early as the Late Bronze Age. The location commands the land routes from Athens to the Peloponnese and NW Greece.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The sanctuary of Demeter is located within the city walls of Eleusis, occupying the area between the E slope of the acropolis and the E fortification wall, and is isolated from the rest of the city by a separate cross-wall at the NE. Within the sanctuary another cross-wall, breached by the Lesser Propylaia divides the N area of the priests' dwellings and administration buildings from the sacred inner peribolos. The main architectural features of the inner sanctuary are the Kallichoron or sacred well, the cave of Pluto adjacent to a triangular court and the Telesterion of Demeter (an almost square building that could seat 3000) where the secret initiation rites were completed and entrance to the uninitiated was forbidden on pain of death. An anaktoron or separate shrine was maintained within the Telesterion. From the outer sanctuary the Greater Propylaia opened onto the grand Sacred Way which joined the sanctuary to Athens.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Traditionally the region of Epidauros is said to have first been inhabited by the Carians. There existed, in Archaic or earlier times, a cult of Malos in the region, but the establishment of a sanctuary to Apollo and Asklepios is not older than the 6th century B.C. It appears that the sanctuary was first dedicated to Apollo and that only in the 5th century B.C. did Apollo's son Asklepios gain prominence.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At the end of the 5th century B.C. and throughout the 4th century the Asklepieion grew in fame and influence. Every 4 years (9 days after the Isthmian Games) the Panhellenic Asklepieia Games were held. At ca. 380 B.C. poetry and music contests were added to the competition. During the 4th century the cult of Asklepios spread throughout the Greek world. Epidauros was claimed as the birthplace of Asklepios and more than 200 new Asklepieia were built (most notably at Athens, Kos, and Pergamon). Also at this time the previously unadorned sanctuary at Epidauros was filled with votive offerings and monuments. Fame and prosperity continued throughout the Hellenistic period.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In 87 B.C. the sanctuary at Epidauros was looted by Sulla and in 67 B.C. it was plundered by pirates. In the 2nd century A.D. the sanctuary enjoyed a new upsurge under the Romans and the worship of new gods from the East was introduced into the sanctuary. In 395 A.D. the Goths raided the sanctuary. Although the cults of the ancient gods died out under Christianity, the sanctuary at Epidauros was known as late as the mid 5th century A.D. as a Christian healing center.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
      <exploration>&lt;P&gt;Excavations: P. Kavvadias and V. Stais of the Greek Archaeological Society began in 1881, the French School of Archaeology for a short time just after W.W. II, and J. Papadimitriou in 1948-51.&lt;/P&gt;</exploration>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;On the E coast of the Argolid, the health spa and religious center at Epidauros maintained a bath, hotels and dwellings for the priest-physicians as well as a tholos building, temples, stoas, gymnasium, palaestra, stadium and a theater. The theater is one of the best preserved ancient structures in Greece and is now used for modern presentations of ancient Greek drama. The Asklepieia (athletic and dramatic festival) was held every 4 years. Epidauros is claimed as the birthplace of Asklepios and it was the most celebrated center of his cult.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <site_type>Fortified city</site_type>
      <description>&lt;P&gt;Eretria was listed in the Homeric Catalogue of Ships, but the location of the earliest city remains uncertain. The Mycenaean and Dark Age settlement at Lefkandi has been proposed as the site of &quot;Old Eretria,&quot; but also as the site of &quot;Old Chalkis.&quot; The earliest evidence for the situation of Eretria at its present location dates to the late Geometric period.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the Geometric period, Eretria, along with Chalkis, led the cities of Greece in establishing colonies abroad. The maritime competition and possibly land disputes between Eretria and Chalkis may have caused the Lelantine War, one of the earliest reported conflicts between Greek city-states, which, according to tradition, continued throughout the 8th century B.C. One outcome of the war may have been the establishment of Eretria at its present location. The earliest remains at the city, including the West Gate Heroon, and sections of city walls and city streets (below the Classical levels) date to the 7th century B.C.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In ca. 500 B.C. Eretria contributed ships and aid to the Ionian Revolt. This resulted in the Persian retaliation in 490 B.C. which caused the destruction of Eretria and enslavement of many of the inhabitants. In 480 B.C. Eretria had recovered sufficiently to join the Greek forces for the defeat of the Persians. Eretria then became a member of the Delian League and remained allied to Athens until 411 B.C. In 411 B.C. Eretria joined (or perhaps led) the rest of Euboea in a Spartan inspired revolt from Athens. During the short-lived period of the Euboean League, the city of Eretria flourished. But by the early 4th century Eretria had reestablished good terms with Athens and during the rest of the century Eretrian political allegiance wavered between Athens and Thebes. By the end of the century Eretria was under the control of the Macedonians.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In 198 B.C. the city was plundered by the Romans and after this time no new building took place. In 87 B.C. it was finally destroyed in the Mithridatic wars and abandoned. The area reverted to and remained swamp land until a refugee settlement (Nea Psara) was located on the site in 1824 A.D.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;Eretria (the ancient city lies beneath the modern town) is located on the S edge of the Lelantine plain, on the W coast of Euboea, ca. 18 km S of Chalkis. The Classical city walls enclosed ca. 80 ha of flat ground between the harbor and the prominent acropolis to the N. The city, which was the most important in Euboea in the late 4th and early 3rd century B.C., was almost rectangular in shape, with the sanctuary of Apollo Daphnephoros at its center. The agora is between the Apollo temenos and the shore. Between the acropolis to the N and the Apollo temenos are the theater, stadium, gymnasium and other sanctuaries. Excavations at the West Gate (opening on the road to Chalkis) have located sections of the late Geometric walls and gate and a late Geometric heroon (hero shrine) beneath a later Hellenistic palace complex.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;The earliest evidence for occupation at the site dates to the Proto-Geometric period: by the 7th century B.C. there was a small fortified settlement on the shore. Early in the 5th century B.C., refugees from Tiryns settled at Halieis and the town expanded in size. During the Classical period Halieis was a pawn in the endless Athens-Sparta conflict and suffered attacks from one side and then the other. The site was abandoned near the end of the 4th century B.C., although there was some minor reoccupation in the late Roman period.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
      <exploration>&lt;P&gt;Excavations in 1962 and 1965-1968 by the University of Pennsylvania directed by M. Jameson and in 1970-1974 by Indiana University directed by W. Rudolph.&lt;/P&gt;</exploration>
      <periods>&lt;P&gt;Archaic&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Classical&lt;/P&gt;</periods>
      <physical>&lt;P&gt;Halieis is located on the E shore of a naturally sheltered, S-facing bay at the S tip of the Argive peninsula. Originally (in the 8th-7th century B.C.) the acropolis and the small settlement at the shore had independent fortification walls. Probably in the 5th century B.C. the town expanded to the E and S up the slopes of the low acropolis hill, and the later city walls enclosed those of the acropolis. In the Classical period the city had at least 4 gates and the walls also enclosed a small fortified military harbor. The streets, houses and workshops of the expanded city were organized on the Hippodamos grid system and there was a separate industrial quarter SE and uphill from the town's center. A Sanctuary of Apollo (now under water) is located ca 500 m NE of the town and contains a temple, altar and stadium.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Traditionally the sanctuary and games of honor of Poseidon were established by the Corinthian King Sisyphos or the Athenian Hero Theseus. The games were reportedly reorganized as a Panhellenic festival during the 49th Olympiad (582-578 B.C.) and held every 2nd spring thereafter. Control of the games was held by Corinth except for the period 146-44 B.C. when Corinth lay in ruins and Sikyon managed the games.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Archaic temenos wall had a N and E propylon and enclosed a temple and altar. Outside the wall was a large 20 m deep well and a 16 lane stadium with a length of 192 m. In the Classical period the temenos was enlarged and stoas added. The original temple, destroyed by fire, was replaced by a temple that stood (with repairs in 390 B.C.) through the Roman period. The deep well outside the wall became a refuge pit and a new, shorter (181 m) stadium was constructed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Classical stadium was replaced in the Hellenistic period by a stadium located ca. 250 m SE of the temenos and at ca. 400 B.C. a theater was built ca. 30 m NE of the temenos. The theater was renovated twice in the Hellenistic period and twice in the Roman period. In the Roman period the temenos was again extended and new stoas built. The Palaimonion cult precinct was attached to the S side of the main temenos over the traditional burial place of Palaimon (associated with the Corinthian foundation legend for the sanctuary).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The sanctuary remained active during the Roman period, until it was sacked by the Goths in A.D. 395 At the beginning of the 6th century A.D. the structures in the sanctuary were pulled down for material to build the nearby fortress and Isthmia wall of Justinian.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
      <exploration>&lt;P&gt;In 1883 P. Monceaus of the French School investigated the site. It was re-studied and some test trenches dug in 1933 by R. Jenkins and A. Megaw. 1952-1961 excavations by University of Chicago directed by O. Broneer, who located the site of the sanctuary and excavated the temenos of Poseidon, the stadium, theater and shrine of Palaimon (including the earlier temple and stadium). 1967-1972 excavations by University of California directed by P. Clement, chiefly of the Isthmian fortifications and burials of the sixth and fifth centuries BC.&lt;/P&gt;</exploration>

Beyond the walls of the temenos are the stadium, theater, Roman Palaimonion shrine, and Roman baths.

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Kalydon was recorded by Homer as the home of Oeneus and the setting of the Caledonian boar hunt. The historical city is little known and apparently unimportant, but the growth of the Sanctuary of Artemis, the construction of the city's walls in the 3rd century B.C., and the size of some of the Hellenistic tombs indicate some prosperity. The city declined in the Roman period, and in 30 B.C. Augustus transferred the inhabitants to the new city of Nikopolis.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Kameiros (together with Lindos and Ialysos) was one of the 3 city-states founded on Rhodes by Dorian Greeks, possibly as early as the Mycenaean period.

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;Kameiros is an unfortified city with well planned streets, civic buildings and public water supply dating to the Hellenistic period. Few of the remains of the earlier Archaic city have been uncovered. The city sits on theater-like slopes facing the sea on the NW coast of Rhodes. In the lower town an agora is partially surrounded by colonnades. From the agora the main street of the city runs uphill and S, through insula of private houses, to the ridge top which serves as the acropolis. Along the ridge top a long stoa faces the sea and behind this is the temple of Athena, originally Archaic, but rebuilt in the Hellenistic period.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Although there is some evidence of earlier occupation at the site, the city of Kassope was built in the Hellenistic period (possibly as a consolidation of smaller villages). The city apparently suffered only minor destruction in 167 B.C. in the period of the Roman conquest. It was probably abandoned in 30 B.C. with the founding of the city of Nikopolis to the S.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
      <exploration>&lt;P&gt;G. Miliadis conducted a trial excavation in 1926. S. Dakaris excavated between 1951 and 1955 and continued in 1977 with the collaboration of W. Hoepfner and L. Schwander of the German Archaeological Institute.&lt;/P&gt;</exploration>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;Kassope lies on a S plateau of Mt. Zalonga in Epirus, ca. 25 km N of modern Preveza and 8 km E of the coast. The city was laid out on the Hippodamian grid plan and had a circuit wall of ca. 3 km in length. The agora is in the SE quarter of the city and flanked by stoas on the N and E. A large theater is located in the NW part of the city and a bouleuterion, a prytaneion, and other public buildings have been identified.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;After a long period of Neolithic occupation (Lerna I and II) the site seems to have been deserted for a time before it was levelled off and reoccupied in the Early Helladic II period (Lerna III). The new settlement had a double ring of defense walls with gates and towers and a number of substantial buildings within. The largest building has been named the House of Tiles because of the unusual early occurrence of terracotta roofing tiles associated with the building. The walls of the large building are nearly 1 m thick and stairs indicate an upper story. The building was perhaps still under construction when the whole settlement was destroyed by fire.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the Early Helladic III period (Lerna IV), the inhabitants (who supposedly destroyed the earlier settlement) covered the site of the House of Tiles with a low tumulus surrounded by a ring of stones, as though to mark off a sacred area.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the Early Helladic III period Lerna was an open settlement of smaller buildings, some of them having an apsidal megaron floor plan. Bothroi, or &quot;rubbish pits&quot; were an unusual characteristic of this settlement. The Early Helladic III levels at Lerna produced, in addition to the typical pottery of that period, a few examples of a pottery type known as &quot;Minyan&quot; ware, which was sometimes wheel-made and is a common feature of the Middle Helladic period. The clearly defined Middle Helladic level at Lerna (Lerna V) follows without a break.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The settlement at Lerna continues to exist throughout the Middle Helladic period, but does not continue into the Late Helladic or Mycenaean period. At the end of the Middle Helladic period, 2 rectangular shaft graves were cut into the tumulus of the House of Tiles, indicating that the meaning of that monument had been forgotten.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;Lerna is one of the largest (ca. 180 sq. m.) prehistoric mounds in S Greece and probably owed its importance to its position on the narrow strip of land between sea and mountains that formed the route from the Argolid to the S Peloponnese.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It is located in the marshy area on the Gulf of Argos (10 km S of Argos). Early Bronze Age Lerna had substantial fortification walls and a palace or administrative center in a central building referred to as the &quot;House of Tiles.&quot; This was a large two-story building with terracotta rooftiles and several storage rooms where clay sealings were found. In Classical times the area was claimed as home of the Nereids, place where Herakles slew the Hydra and location of the entrance to Hades (through the Aleyonean Lake).&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;The site of Mallia was 1st settled in the Early Minoan I period (ca. 3000 B.C.) and the 1st palace construction dates to the beginning of Middle Minoan I (ca. 1900 B.C.). Although the original structure at Mallia had all the essential elements of a Minoan Palace, it was less elaborate and complex that the other known palaces and there was less extensive use of upper stories, light wells, and staircases. As a result, when the great earthquake struck Crete near the end of the Middle Minoan II period (at ca. 1700 B.C.), Mallia suffered less damage than the other palaces and was rebuilt with little alteration. At Knossos and the other palaces, however, there was extensive rebuilding and renovation. The excavations at the palace and town of Mallia, therefore, provide much information about earlier (Old Palatial Period, or pre-earthquake) Middle Minoan architecture.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Mallia, as almost all of the Minoan palaces and sites, suffered a violent destruction and burning at the end of Late Minoan Ib (ca. 1400 B.C.), and was completely abandoned. Only one small building was later built over the site and a settlement of the Geometric period at Mallia avoided the ancient site itself. This later history has helped to make Mallia one of the best preserved and most informative of all Minoan sites.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;Located on the N coast of Crete ca. 34 km E of Knossos, in a small fertile plain near the foothills of Mount Dicte. As at Knossos and other Minoan palaces, the rooms, magazines, and corridors of the palace were arranged around a rectangular central court. At Mallia, however, there were more utilitarian work rooms, storage rooms, and grain silos and fewer luxurious private rooms which gives the Mallia palace more of a country villa or farm estate character.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Associated with the palace are the houses and buildings of a considerable town, paved roadways, and cemeteries, including the Khrysolakko cemetery which has yielded some of the finest examples of Middle Minoan gold work and jewelry.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Mallia is one of the smaller (ca. 8000 sq. m) of the known palace sites and its ancient name is unknown, but it has the best preserved ground plan of all palace sites and extensive well-preserved remains in the associated town.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Megalopolis was founded ca. 370 B.C. by Epaminondas of Thebes as the capital of the Arcadian League and as a buffer city to help contain the Spartans. During the 4th century B.C. Megalopolis politically favored Macedonia and suffered a number of Spartan attacks. In the 3rd century the city joined the Achaean League. In 223 B.C. the Spartans (under Cleomenes III) succeeded in taking and destroying Megalopolis. The city was rebuilt and enjoyed some prosperity, but never regained political power, and by the 2nd century A.D. it was a minor town much in ruin. It was finally abandoned at the end of the Roman period.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

The city was protected by ca. 9 km of city walls and occupied by the inhabitants of ca. 40 abandoned Arcadian villages. On the N bank the civic center of the city included the agora, stoas, the Philippian Stoa, Sanctuary of Zeus Soter, and other civic buildings. The S bank section of the city was the center of the Arcadian League and the location of the Thersileion (the league's council house). The theater in the S sector was the largest in Greece with ca. 20,000 seats.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

Ithome was mentioned by Homer and its summit served as a religious center and refuge for the Messenians at least since the Archaic period. From the acropolis almost all of the state of Messenia is visible.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The 4th century B.C. fortification walls of Messene (still well preserved) totaled a length of ca. 9 km and enclosed the acropolis as well as large tracts of agricultural land that could serve as a place of refuge for inhabitants from the countryside. A Sanctuary of Asklepios, theater, stadium and other public buildings were also enclosed within the fortifications. The circuit walls (ca. 2.5 m thick and 4.5 m high) included at least 4 well-designed city gates and over 30 towers.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Mycenae, on a naturally defensible hill with a commanding view and plentiful nearby fresh water, was first occupied in the Neolithic period. Habitation continued throughout the Early and Middle Helladic periods and the first palace complex was probably built at the beginning of the Late Helladic period.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the Late Helladic IIIA period the fortifications probably followed the natural boundary of the hilltop. In Late Helladic IIIB the circuit was enlarged to the S and W, and toward the end of Late Helladic IIIB an E extension to the citadel was added with a sally port and access to an underground water supply. It was at this time that the great Lion Gate was also constructed. The citadel and palace of Mycenae were destroyed at the end of the Late Helladic IIIB, although some occupation continued at the site during the Late Helladic IIIC period.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the Geometric period only a few small houses occupied the summit of the hill. In the Archaic period a temple was built on the summit. During the Persian Wars Mycenae sent a small force to fight at Thermopylae and Plataea. In 468 B.C. Argos destroyed the acropolis at Mycenae and the city later came under direct Argive control. As a deme of Argos the acropolis was rebuilt and fortification walls were built around the lower town. The site continued to be inhabited until the end of the 3rd century A.D.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

The palace consisted of a central megaron meeting hall, throne room and courtyard with adjacent private quarters, storerooms, guard stations and administrative rooms. Outside the Lion Gate and massive walls of the citadel are found the private houses, workshops, public works and other features of the dispersed settlement and the tholos tombs of the ruling clans.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;There is evidence of settlement in the area of Olympia from the Early Bronze Age on, and although there is no archaeological proof for prehistoric cult activity at Olympia, tradition records that it was originally a place sacred to Ge, Cronus (the Mother of Gods), and Eileithyia as well as a cult center of the hero Pelops. At some time after the end of the Late Bronze Age the cult of Zeus was introduced and a walled sacred precinct was established.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At 776 B.C. (the date marking the beginning of the historical period) the religious games were reorganized and established as the Panhellenic Olympiads. Olympia developed rapidly and the sanctity of the sanctuary and the Olympic Truce (in effect for a short period every 4 years throughout Greece to protect pilgrims) were almost never violated.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;During the Archaic period, the fame of the sanctuary grew and Greeks of the mainland and the colonies around the Mediterranean participated. The first monumental temple to Zeus and Hera was built in the second half of the 7th century B.C. and most of the treasuries were built in the 6th century and 1st half of the 5th century. The original Archaic stadium began at the Great Altar of Zeus and stretched along in front of the treasuries. In the following centuries, however, it was twice moved farther E, until, in the 4th century B.C., it reached its present location outside the sanctuary proper.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the 5th century B.C. the sanctuary reached the peak of its fame. Olympia, however, remained predominantly a Greek cult center (in contrast to the Apollo sanctuaries at Delphi and Delos) and until the Roman period only Greeks were allowed to complete. At 470-456 B.C. the great temple of Zeus was built and housed the giant chryselephantine statue of Zeus (one of the 7 wonders of the ancient world).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Despite local wars in the later Classical period (Arkadia held Olympia from 364-362 B.C.), the fame and prosperity of the sanctuary continued to grow.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the Hellenistic period construction in the center of the sanctuary was restricted to restoration and repair, but much new building activity took place outside the temenos to provide additional accommodations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In 85 B.C. Sulla robbed the treasuries and held the 175th Olympiad at Rome. The sanctuary recovered its games and prestige in the time of Augustus, but the games were again interrupted in 69 A.D. to accommodate Nero. Although the Herulian barbarians did not reach Olympia, threat of their advance caused the Eleans to demolish some of the sanctuary buildings to build a fortification wall. The sanctuary continued to function in a poor manner and with minor restorations for another century. The end came with the decree of Theodosius prohibiting pagan worship.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;In NW Peloponnese, at the confluence of Alpheios and Kladeos Rivers, Olympia sits in a fertile pastoral region surrounded by wooded rolling hills. A cult center since the Mycenaean period, the cult of Zeus was introduced in pre-Archaic times. Religious athletic games were reorganized in 776 BC and were held every 4 years until banned ca. 390 A.D. The sanctuary was constantly embellished during the thousand years of its existence to include temples, treasuries, bouleuterion, stadium, hippodrome, baths, dwellings for the priests and officials and accommodations for the pilgrims and athletes. There were thousands of altars, statues, decrees and votives in the temenos. The Altis or sacred grove, the temple of Hera, and the temple and altar of Zeus were the most important elements of the precinct. There were originally 2 and later 4 oracles.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Pella was founded ca. 400 B.C. as the new capital of Macedonia by King Archelaus. The city was the birthplace of Philip II and Alexander the Great and it grew in size and prestige at a pace with the Hellenistic Empire. The city reached its peak in political and artistic influence at ca. 274-239 B.C.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With the defeat of the last king of Macedonia in 168 B.C. Pella lost importance and was overshadowed by the growing city of Thessalonica on the coast.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Perhaps due to the scarcity of fresh water, there was no settlement and only occasional habitation on the Perachora promontory prior to the Geometric period when the territory (originally belonging to Megara) came under Corinthian control. It was strategically important that Corinth control the Perachora because it could serve an enemy as a strong base near the Isthmus and Corinth and because it provided an ideal observation point for ship movement in the whole W part of the Corinthian Gulf.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The 1st temple and precinct of Hera Akraia was established by the Corinthians on the W tip of the promontory early in the Geometric period. There is strong indication that Argos also played a role in the foundation of this new Heraion.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the later Geometric period (2nd half of the 8th century B.C.), a 2nd temple and precinct, the so-called Hera Limenia, was built ca. 200 m E and up the valley from the 1st precinct. The 2nd enclosure may have been a separate sanctuary dedicated to Hera Limenia, or it may have been an extension or annex to the precinct of Hera Akraia. In the latter case the 2nd (8th century) temple may have replaced the original temple at the shore or it may have been a treasury or structure to house the ever accumulating votive offerings of Hera rather than an actual temple. The original sacred precinct of Hera Akraia is in a confined space hemmed in by sea and cliffs and a large number of offerings and votive gifts were brought into the sanctuary during the 8th century B.C. An annex to the popular sanctuary of Hera Akraia appears more logical than the construction of a new and competitive sanctuary of Hera.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After the establishment of the Hera Limenia precinct the original shore side precinct of Hera Akraia was renovated and a new temple of Hera built in the 6th century B.C.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;From the 8th century through the Classical period, votive gifts and offerings continue to enrich both precincts. In the 8th and 7th centuries B.C. Corinth became more independent from Argos and began to send out colonists and traders to the W. The Hera sanctuary was the last point of Corinthian territory that colonists would pass and the first point that returning merchants would reach and this undoubtedly accounted for many offerings to secure or give thanks for safe voyages and enterprises.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Classical period brought another phase of building activity at the sanctuary. The area of the Hera Akraia precinct was remodeled and a stoa and agora were added. The approach to the Hera Limenia precinct and part of that temenos were also remodeled.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;There had been habitations and fortifications built in the neighborhood of the sanctuary as early as the original Geometric period foundations and additional buildings of this nature appear in the Classical period.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Heraion was still important and active in the Hellenistic period and new buildings and cisterns appear in the neighborhood. The sanctuary, however, had been completely abandoned after the Roman sack of 146 B.C. and Roman houses were built over its ruins.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

Two sacred precincts existed: Hera Limenia above the harbor with an 8th century B.C. temple and Hera Akraia by the harbor with a 6th century B.C. temple. House remains, cisterns, an agora and stoa were part of the settlement around the sanctuaries. There may have been an oracle at the sanctuaries.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Prior to the 5th century B.C., the Athenians kept their warships at the beach of Phaleron Bay, E of the Munichia peninsula. As Athens grew to rival the major maritime powers of Corinth and Aegina, Themistocles created an Athenian fleet of 200 ships and in 493 expanded the fortifications of the Piraeus which Hippias had started in 527-510 B.C. In addition to the fortifications, ship sheds, dry docks, storage buildings, and arsenals were built to serve as base for the fleet.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After the interruption of the Persian invasion in 480 B.C., the work continued and at ca. 450 B.C. the architect Hippodamos of Miletus laid out a new city grid plan (one of the earliest employment of this plan in Greece), and the Long Walls to Athens were constructed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Long Walls and fortifications were destroyed on order of the Spartans at the end of the Peloponnese War in 404 B.C., but rebuilt by Konon in 393 B.C.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Piraeus was pillaged by Sulla in 86 B.C., but enjoyed a revival under Hadrian and the Antonines in the 2nd century A.D. In 267 A.D. the city was raided by the Herulians, and after another destruction by Alaric in 396 A.D. it lost its importance as a major port city.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;The 3 natural harbors (Zea and Munichia on the E and Kantharos on the W) of the peninsula were enhanced with fortified moles and narrowed entrances that could be closed by chains. The peninsula was enclosed by fortifications and 3 long walls provided a secure corridor to Athens. Piraeus was laid out and built on a grid plan by Hippodamos of Miletus. In addition to a spacious agora at the center of the city and numerous public and religious buildings, many quays, warehouses, arsenals, dry docks and over 300 ship-sheds served the Athenian fleet and commercial interests. A majority of the inhabitants were &quot;Metics&quot; or resident aliens which gave the city a cosmopolitan character.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;The site was occupied at least as early as the Middle Bronze Age. The Mycenaean palace (which seems to have replaced an earlier fortified palace) was built near the end of the Late Bronze Age (LH IIIB, ca. 1300 B.C.) and shortly thereafter the site was destroyed and abandoned.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Pylos is the best preserved of all the Mycenaean palaces and is especially important for the hundreds of Linear B clay tablets found (accidentally preserved through baking in the fire that destroyed the palace) at the site.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;Located near Navarino Bay and modern Pylos (close to village of Khora) on the hill of Epano Englianos. The site compares in size and richness with the palace of Mycenae and is believed to be the home of Nestor, the second most powerful Mycenaean king. The palace consisted of two-storied buildings arranged in three main blocks: the main building with a megaron hall (containing the throne), propylon, archives (with hundreds of clay tablets preserved), magazines and private chambers. The SW and NE blocks contained workshops, storerooms and private chambers. The palace was apparently unfortified. Tholos tombs and a lower town are associated with the palace.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;The deme center at Rhamnous was fortified in the 5th or 4th century B.C. and probably received a permanent garrison because of its strategic position. The cult of Nemesis and Themis was well known at Rhamnous as early as the 6th century B.C. and the smaller and earlier temple (ca. 480 B.C.) may have been dedicated to both of the gods. The later temple (ca. 420 B.C.) was dedicated to Nemesis alone, but was left unfinished.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
      <exploration>&lt;P&gt;Society of Dilettanti made plans of the temples of Nemesis and Themis in 1817. Minor excavation on the acropolis by D. Philios in 1880. 1890-1893 M. Stais continued on the acropolis and in the sanctuary. In 1922-23 and in 1947 studies and surveys carried out by: A. Orlandos, Zschietzschmann, Plommer, Dinsmoor, J. Pouilloux and J. Marcad&eacute;.

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;Rhamnous was a remote Attic deme center on a small sheltered bay along the rocky NE Attic coast. It was strategically important because it overlooked a narrow stretch of the Euboean channel. After Athens lost Dekelia in 412 B.C., it also became important as the main harbor for import of food supplies from Euboea. The hamlet at Rhamnous had a small temple, a gymnasium and a small theater which may have served for civic assemblies as well as performances. Within the town's fortifications a hill top was enclosed in a 2nd circuit of walls and may have held a permanent Athenian garrison.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A route led from the town, through the necropolis and up to the Sanctuary of Nemesis and Themis situated on an artificial terrace facing the sea. The temenos was entered from the SE and contained 2 small, closely adjacent temples and a number of sculptures and dedications.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;The earliest evidence for occupation at the site goes back to the Early Bronze Age, but the first structures of a definite religious character (altar and temple) date to the Dark Ages.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The sanctuary may have served a local Carian divinity originally, but the Hellenic religion probably arrived with the early Ionian colonists. According to Greek myth, it was here, beside a sacred bush, that Hera was born and married. A festival was held every year at the Heraion to celebrate the marriage of Hera and Zeus.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the mid 6th century B.C. the sanctuary was enlarged and embellished during the reign of Polycrates and the 1st Great Hera Temple was built by the architect Rhoikos.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At ca. 530 B.C. Samos was captured by the Persians and the Hera Temple was destroyed by fire. A 2nd Great Temple was started at the end of the 6th century B.C., but it was never completed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Samos was a member of the Delian League and became an Athenian colony in 365 B.C. After 190 B.C. Samos came under the control of Pergamon and finally under Roman rule. The sanctuary continued to develop throughout the Hellenistic and Roman periods, but was plundered a number of times by pirates and barbarians during its later history. It was also plundered by Antony in 39 B.C., but Augustus restored many of its art works.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;The low mound of Sesklo, which sits in the fork of 2 small gullies is ca 100 by 45 m in area. The prehistoric deposits which vary from 3 to 6 m in depth indicate occupation through all of the prehistoric periods, from the earliest phase of the Neolithic to the end of the Bronze Age.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The earliest settlement at Sesklo may have had a fortification wall, but the evidence is indefinite (some traces of an unusually thick wall are found at the E end of the site). The houses of the 1st settlement were built of wattle and daub on wooden frame in rectangular plan. Houses with and without stone foundations are known.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the 2nd period, the main phase of the Thessalian Middle Neolithic, the same construction methods are used and evidence for fortification of the settlement is stronger, but still inconclusive. One large building of megaron type appears. The Middle Neolithic is the major period of the site and is characterized by the distinctive Sesklo pottery. The Middle Neolithic settlement was destroyed by fire and a 500 year hiatus in occupation followed before the site was reoccupied in the Late Neolithic. After the Middle Neolithic the remains from Sesklo are meager and unimportant.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Sanctuary founded as early as 700 B.C. The marble temple of Poseidon was built in the mid 5th century B.C. to replace an earlier temple destroyed by the Persians in 480. The site was fortified during the Peloponnese War to protect ships carrying grain to Athens. These fortifications were repaired and expanded and a ship-shed built on the E side of the cape during the Hellenistic period.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;The small sanctuary of Poseidon is located within the fortified port town of Sounion, on a rocky peninsula 69 km SE of Athens. Inside the temenos a stoa stands along the N and W precinct wall. The temple of Poseidon occupied the center of the precinct. North of the sanctuary is a smaller sanctuary dedicated to Athena Sounias. The town of Sounion was a port of call for Athenian grain ships from Euboea and the sanctuary of Poseidon served as a refuge for slaves escaping from the Laurion silver mines.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;The location of Homeric Sparta is uncertain, and historical Sparta was traditionally a Dorian foundation of the 10th century B.C. By the 7th century B.C. Sparta had conquered all of Laconia and Messenia and by the 6th century all of the central and SW Peloponnese was under direct Spartan control.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the 5th century B.C. Sparta had control of the Peloponnesian League and in 405 B.C. defeated Athens. The reversal of Spartan power, however, began with their defeat by Thebes in 371 B.C. In 369 B.C. Messenia was liberated and by 195 B.C. Sparta had lost all of its political dependencies.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Under the Romans, Sparta enjoyed a degree of prosperity, in part, because of Roman admiration of the Spartan tradition of discipline. The Romans revived the ancient initiation rites for Spartan youths at the Sanctuary of Artemis, but in a debased touristic manner in which the Spartan youths were flogged in an amphitheater constructed around the altar of Artemis. Sparta survived the Herulian invasions of 267 A.D., but was devastated by the Goths in 395 A.D. and finally abandoned.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;Located ca. 50 km inland on the wide and fertile plain of the Eurotas valley, Sparta is almost completely surrounded by major mountain ranges. In contrast to other ancient Greek cities, Sparta was not a compact fortified city-state center with monumental civic and religious buildings. It was a loose collection of smaller villages spaced over a large rural area and 6 low hills (cf. Thuc. 1.10.2). The highest of these knolls (ca. 25 m) served as the acropolis and location for the Temple of Athena Chalkioikos. In the Hellenistic period a theater, stoa and agora were built near the acropolis, but the Temple of Athena and the earlier remains at the Sanctuary of Artemis Orthia on the W bank of the Eurotas are almost the only archaeological remains from Archaic and Classical Sparta.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The location and the militaristic character of early Sparta made city walls unnecessary, but as Spartan power weakened construction of fortification walls began (in 307 B.C.). The 10 km long circuit wall was completed in 184 B.C.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;The island of Thasos has been inhabited since the Neolithic period. According to tradition the island takes its name from Thasos, the leader of a group of Phoenician traders who were exploiting the gold mines of the island in the Early Iron Age when the island was inhabited by a Thracian tribe. Around 680 B.C. Ionian Greeks from Paros colonized the island.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thasos reached its greatest prosperity during the Archaic and early Classical period due to its position on the sea routes, its supply of timber and marble for export, and in particular its gold mines.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The island submitted to the Persians in 491 and 480 B.C. In 477 Thasos joined the Athenian controlled Delian League. The island was unsuccessful in attempts to withdraw from Athenian dominance in 464 and 411 B.C. and in 377 B.C. it joined the 2nd Athenian League.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the Hellenistic and Roman periods Thasos had little political power, but remained prosperous.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

The extant walls of Thasos date mainly to ca. 411 B.C., but rest on earlier foundations of walls demolished first by order of the Persians (491 B.C.), and again by order of the Athenians (463 B.C.). Several of the extant city gates, however, date to the earlier Archaic circuit.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Within the ca. 4 km long walls of the city are a number of sanctuaries (including those to Poseidon, Artemis, Herakles and Dionysos), residential and commercial buildings, and the agora in the lower town. The agora is located at the center of the city's shore line, with a gateway to the adjacent fortified harbor. The agora was surrounded by stoas and public buildings and contained many altars and small shrines.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The city walls extend to the SW to enclose the 3 summits of the acropolis where individual sanctuaries to Apollo, Athena and Pan are located. In the Roman period an odeion, basilica and monumental arch were added. The Greek theater on the slope, along the E wall of the city was remodeled by the Romans to serve as an arena.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;The site was first settled in the Late Bronze Age. At sometime in the Geometric period the site took on a religious character as evidenced by the remains of Megaron B, a cult building with an elliptical colonnade (which may, however, have been added at a later date).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Above the Megaron B temple an Archaic temple was built which was then replaced after 206 B.C. by the final temple of Apollo Thermios. In the Classical period the site became a Pan-Aetolian sanctuary and the meeting place for members of the Aetolian League. Annual festivals were held and the election of magistrates took place in the bouleuterion at the site. The fortification of the sanctuary probably occurred after the invasion of Antipater and Krateros in 323 B.C.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thermon was plundered by Philip V of Macedon in 218 and 206 B.C., but it continued to function until ca. 168 B.C. when the League was reduced. The discovery of 1st century B.C. graves in the temenos area indicates that the site was no longer a sacred precinct by this time.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;Located on a mountain plateau above the NE shore of Lake Trichonis in W Central Greece, the fortified temenos occupied an area of 340 by 200 m. It contained 3 temples, 3 stoas, a fountain and spring, agora, and a bouleuterion as well as exedra and votive sculpture. Fragmentary remains of an early (ca. 630-610 B.C.) Doric temple were found below the later temple of Apollo Thermios and above the so-called Megaron B, a possible temple of Geometric date. There was also a temple of Artemis at the sanctuary.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Occupation on the site of Thorikos began in the Neolithic period. Prehistoric and Mycenaean settlements were centered on the Velatouri hill and tombs of the Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age are found on the lower slopes of the hill, beneath the Classical levels. Traditionally, Thorikos was one of the 12 independent cities of Attica unified by Theseus.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Although fortified late in the Peloponnesian War, Thorikos did not seem to play an important role in Attic history. The site was abandoned early in the Roman period and not reoccupied.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
      <exploration>&lt;P&gt;The Society of Dilettanti excavated the Temple of Demeter and Kore in 1817 and the American School excavated the theater in 1886. In the 1890's Stais excavated Mycenaean remains on the acropolis. Since 1960 the Belgian Mission, directed by H. Mussche has conducted systematic research and excavations.&lt;/P&gt;</exploration>

The town extended from the Haghios Nikalaos promontory (between 2 bays) inland and up the slopes of the Velatouri hill, which served as the acropolis.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The town was fortified by a wall and at least 7 gateways at ca. 412 B.C. to protection the Laurion mining district and the coastal sea lanes. Below the acropolis, on the S slope, an industrial quarter included establishments for the processing of metal ore. Lower on the S slope is the ca. 5th century B.C. theater with an unusual oval orchestra. West of the theater stood a temple of Dionysos. Much of the rest of the S slope was taken up by domestic buildings.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Didyma was originally a pre-Greek cult center with a spring and sacred grove. The Ionian Greeks adopted and Hellenized the center and by the 7th century B.C. the fame of its oracle had spread to as far as Egypt. The earliest temple of Apollo on the site was an unroofed Ionic building enclosing the sacred spring and a Naiskos. It was completed in the first half of the 6th century B.C. A second and larger temple on the same spot was destroyed by the Persians early in the 5th century B.C. while it was still under construction.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Little is known about activities at Didyma during the 5th and 4th centuries B.C., it it seems to have suffered a decline. The sanctuary and the office of the oracle was revived at ca. 311 B.C. when the sacred spring reappeared (or was rediscovered) on the occassion of a visit from Alexander the Great. In the following decades Selencus embellished the sanctuary and commissioned the new Hellenistic Temple of Apollo. The sanctuary grew in wealth and fame and work on the temple continued for the next 200 years.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In 278 B.C. the sanctuary suffered under the raids of Gauls, but construction work on the temple was resumed. At 70 B.C. the sanctuary was sacked by pirates and work on the temple stopped. The sanctuary continued to function and in A.D. 100. Trajan commissioned a new paved road to the sanctuary from Miletus.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By the 3rd century A.D. Christianity had become well established in the Miletus area and the sanctuary at Didyma fell into disuse. At ca. A.D. 262 the Temple of Apollo (which had never been completed, despite five centuries of service), was converted into a fortress against the invading Goths.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;Located ca. 10 km S of the city of Miletus and inland from the small port of Panormos, the site of Didyma (a pre-Hellenic name) was a cult center with a spring and sacred grove before the arrival of the Ionian Greeks. In the Archaic period the first temple of Apollo was constructed and a Sacred Way, lined with sculptures, led from Panormos to the sanctuary. Additional structures at the sanctuary included a temenos wall, stoas, and a circular altar and a sacred well before the temple.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The open-cella Archaic temple was replaced by a larger unroofed temple in the Hellenistic period. The Hellenistic temple of Apollo, although never completed, survives as one of the largest and most impressive examples of ancient Greek architecture. The temple housed a small Naiskos within the open cella and had an unusual room between the pronaos and cella which may have served as the Chresmographeion (office of the oracle). Also present at the sanctuary were other shrines, a stadium, and a settlement of priests and attendants. Although musical and drama contests were held as part of the Festival of the Great Didymeia every four years, there is no theater nor odeion at the sanctuary.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;The remains of the city on Mt. Mykale are positively identified as Priene by inscriptions and coins. Practically no remains dating to earlier than the mid-fourth century were found at the site, however, despite its extensive excavation. The Germans concluded from this and from the layout of the city that Priene had moved to this site in the mid-fourth century from an earlier, yet undiscovered spot. They attributed the move to the silting of the Maeander river, which also engulfed Myus, Miletus and other nearby cities, as well, later, as Priene itself (&lt;bibl n=&quot;Strabo 12.8.17&quot;&gt;Strabo 12.8.17&lt;/bibl&gt;); other scholars have suggested that Mausolus, Athens or other agencies were also involved. Such a move is not attested in the literary sources, and in fact, as Demand has pointed out, some sources seem to imply that Priene was always located in the same place (e.g. &lt;bibl n=&quot;Strabo 14.1.12&quot;&gt;Strabo 14.1.12&lt;/bibl&gt;; &lt;bibl n=&quot;Paus. 7.2.10&quot;&gt;Paus. 7.2.10&lt;/bibl&gt;; see &lt;bibl&gt;Demand 1990, 139-146&lt;/bibl&gt;; &lt;bibl&gt;Phoenix 40 (1986) 36-44&lt;/bibl&gt;). However, the archaeological evidence, including the lack of earlier coins and pottery, earlier architecture or architectural fragments, and the layout of the city, of which the mid-fourth century temple of Athena forms an integral part, seem to show conclusively that there was no earlier occupation at this site.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The end of the city is also problematic. Most of the houses seem to have been destroyed by fire in the second half of the second century BC, and never reoccupied. The bulk of the finds from the excavation come from this destruction level. Parts of the city, including many of the major public buildings, were occupied into the Roman period, though, and a Byzantine chapel attests occupation in that era.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
      <exploration>&lt;P&gt;The Society of Dilettanti sent three missions to Priene, in 1764-6, 1811-12 and 1868-9; excavations conducted during the last mission, by Richard Popplewell Pullan, uncovered the Temple and Temenos of Athena Polias. In 1895-1989 a German expedition led by Th. Wiegand and H. Schrader excavated much of the rest of the city, including the agora, further sanctuaries, and houses. Recent research by the German Archaeological Institute has refined their findings.&lt;/P&gt;</exploration>
      <periods>&lt;P&gt;Classical&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Hellenistic&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Roman&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Byzantine&lt;/P&gt;</periods>
      <physical>&lt;P&gt;The city of Priene lies on the southern slopes of Mt. Mykale overlooking the Maeander river. The city largely excavated by the Germans in the late 19th century is planned on a strict grid, defying the steeply sloping topography of the site and imposing a rational human order on the landscape. Its well-preserved remains, with its temple of Athena, well-planned agora, theater, stadium, gymnasium, fortification walls and many excavated houses, form one of the best examples of a small Greek polis.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The city was laid out on a rectangular grid, with blocks measuring about 120 x 160 feet (35.40 x 47.20 m), a proportion of 3:4. These blocks were originally divided into 8 rather long and narrow houses, although later rebuilding has obscured much of the original scheme (see &lt;bibl&gt;Hoepfner &amp; Schwandner 1986, 153, 169-75, fig. 147, etc.&lt;/bibl&gt;; this original grid is included in the Perseus site plans in lighter lines, together with the excavated sections of walls which conform to this grid, in heavier lines). The plan was applied rather ruthlessly to the landscape, requiring extensive terracing, with some streets transformed to steep flights of stairs. Some of the flatter areas of the city were reserved for the major public buildings: the Temple of Athena Polias, among the first structures to be built in the newly-moved city, and the agora, an open area surrounded by stoas. The theater was set into the side of the hill above the agora. The streets vary in width depending on their position in the city and the traffic they were intended to bear: thus the main east-west street (the &quot;&lt;hi rend=&quot;ital&quot;&gt;Westtorstrasse&lt;/hi&gt;&quot;) is 5.55-5.60 m wide, about 19 Ionic feet; the street east of the Prytaneion 4.30 m (almost 15 feet), other streets average about 3.45 m wide, about 12 feet. Hoepfner and Schwandner restore an original scheme in which the north-south streets widen progressively towards the center of the city, from 12 feet at the gates to 16 and then 20 feet at the agora.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The impressive fortification walls also included the acropolis above the city. This was a relatively empty area, though, without much occupation other than defenses and barracks. The walls enclosed some 37 ha., of which the built-up lower city covered some 15 ha.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;At the time of Homer, Rhodes was under the control of the three independent Dorian cities of Lindos, Ialysos, and Kameiros. The early history of the island is not well known, but its location at the S edge of the Greek world insured a rich commerce with Egypt and the East. The three cities of Rhodes, together with the island of Kos and the Anatolian cities of Knidos and Halikarnassos made up the confederation of the Doric Hexapolis.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In 490 B.C. Rhodes came under the control of the Persians. With the defeat of the Persians in Greece, Rhodes was compelled to join the Delian League in 478 B.C., but it resigned from the League in 411 B.C. The three main cities of Rhodes formed a union in 408 B.C. and established the new federal capital at the N end of the island, which they populated with their own citizens. The new city of Rhodes became immediately prosperous as the three older cities declined in size.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the 4th century B.C. Rhodes submitted first to Sparta, then to Athens, and in 357 B.C. became an ally of Persia. During the 4th and 3rd centuries B.C. Rhodes was one of the greatest commercial and cultural centers of the ancient world. When an earthquake devestated the city in 222 B.C. its reputation as a center of arts and literature drew international aid for its rebuilding.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the 2nd century B.C. Rome greatly weakened the economic position of Rhodes when it established Delos as a preeminent maritime center and free port. Rhodes continued, however, to remain a center of culture and a major commercial port throughout the ancient and Medieval periods.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
      <exploration>&lt;P&gt;The Italians began excavations on the acropolis in 1916 under Maiuri and continued in 1917-1929 under Jacopi and Laurenzi. In 1922-1925 Italian excavations were carried out in the Old City. Since 1951 the Greek Archaeological Service, represented by Kondis have worked in the Old City.&lt;/P&gt;</exploration>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;In 407 B.C. the Rhodian union established the new capital city in a triangular area at the N tip of the island. The city was built on the Hippodamian grid system with streets and underground drains oriented N-S and E-W. The new city walls followed the coasts on the E and W sides of the triangle and became well respected for their strength. At the S base of the triangle, on the landward side of the city, the walls followed the land contours best suited for defense.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Two natural harbors, enhanced by the construction of moles, were located on the E side of the city. The main harbor may have been the location for the Colossus of Rhodes which had been erected in 290 B.C. and was destroyed by earthquake in 225 B.C. North of the central port was a smaller harbor An unsheltered landing S of the port also served the busy maritime activities of the city. On the less sheltered W coast of the city a smaller harbor could be used in good weather.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The terrain of Rhodes rises slightly to a low ridge in the W where the unfortified acropolis is located. The temple of Zeus and Athena and the sanctuary of Pythian Apollo occupy the acropolis and a stadium, gymnasium and small theater are located just below and E of the summit. The main theater of the city is located near the S city wall. Beyond the S wall are the extensive necropoloi of the city.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Karystos was listed in the Homeric Catalog of Ships and the nearby Sanctuary of Poseidon at the harbor of Geraistos was recorded by Homer as the first safe stopping place for the ships returning from the Trojan War. Very little is known, however, about the early history of the Karystia.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Karystos is strategically located at the S entrance to the Euripos Channel and it was a major objective of the first Persian advance in 490 B.C. In contrast to the other Greek islands and states along the Persian route, however, Karystos did not submit to the Persians without a fight. The Persians easily defeated the Karystians and in 490 B.C. In 480, when the Persians returned the second time, Karystos surrendered without a battle.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After the defeat of the Persians on the mainland, Athens forced Karystos into the Delian League, seized the Karystian port at Geraistos, and probably imposed an Athenian clerouchy on the territory.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With the exception of a short period of Spartan influence in Euboea at the end of the 5th century B.C., Karystos remained first subject to and then allied with Athens until Greece became a part of the Macedonian empire after 322 B.C.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Karystos, due largely to its important maritime location and in part to its natural resources, remained prosperous throughout the Hellenistic and Roman periods.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;The modern town of Karystos, built in the 19th century A.D., is located on the N shore of the large Karystos Bay, at the S base of Mt. Ochi. The definite location of the ancient city has not been determined by excavation. Recent topographical research, however, indicates that the earliest city, of the Geometric and Archaic periods, was situated just north of the Plakari Ridge at the NW edge of the bay. During the Hellenistic and later periods the city of Karystos was centered at modern Paliochora, 3 km N of the modern town. The exact date and reasons for the transfer of the ancient city from Plakari to Paliochora remains unknown. The harbor of post-Archaic Karystos was probably located at the small bay of Geraistos, ca. 14 km to the E of Paliochora.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;When the Aeolian Greeks colonized the island of Samothrace at ca. 700 B.C., they adopted and Hellenized the existing cults and the religious center W of their new city. The original rock altar of the Mother Goddess and other features and elements of the fertility and mystery cults were encorporated into the enlarged sanctuary and the Thracian language continued to be used in religious rituals up to the 1st century B.C.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the 6th century B.C. the political power of Samothrace reached its peak, but it was in the 5th century, when the island was subject to the Delian League, that the Sanctuary of the Great Gods began to grow in international repute.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;During the Hellenistic and Roman periods the sanctuary grew to its largest extent and became the chief religious site in the N Aegean region. The fame of the cult of the Mysteries at Samothrace was surpassed only by that at Eleusis.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the 3rd century B.C. the first marble structures were added to the site and during the 3rd and 2nd centuries B.C. the Arsinoeion rotunda, the Ptolemaion Gateway, and the theater were constructed as the area of the sanctuary was extended to the W.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In 84 B.C. the sanctuary was plundered by pirates, but it was restored with Roman aid. The cults continued to function, but after an earthquake in A.D. 200 the sanctuary began to decline. Cult activity was halted in the late 4th century A.D. and the final destruction occurred with an earthquake in the 6th century A.D.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Already mentioned in Homer's Iliad, Mantinea of the Classical period was a synoicism of 5 smaller villages. It was one of the most important of Arkadian cities and a rival of Tegea. Mantinea was allied with Sparta until the Peloponnesian War when it sided with Athens.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In 385 B.C. Sparta destroyed Mantinea and dispersed the inhabitants. In 371 B.C. the city was rebuilt with new fortification walls and repopulated. In 370 B.C. Lykomedes of Mantinea instigated the foundation of the Arkadian League, but in 364 the city left the league to form a new alliance with Sparta.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In 222 B.C. the city revolted against Macedonian control and suffered destruction by Antigonos Doson, who then rebuilt the city and renamed it Antigoneia, a name that it retained until the 2nd century A.D.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;Located ca. 12 km NE of modern Tripolis on the upland plain, Mantinea occupied the area of 5 smaller villages that had synoicized at an uncertain date (cf. Tegea). The oldest section of the city was centered on the Gortsouli (ancient Ptolis) hill.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the 4th century B.C. the city was rebuilt and new city walls, ca. 4 km in length, were built with over 100 towers and 9 or 10 gates. The course of the river Ophis was altered to provide additional defense. The city walls are among the best fortifications of Classical Greece and may have been designed by the same Thebian engineer who planned the walls of Messene. The city had a Temple of Hera and a colonnaded agora with a theater at its W end.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Tegea, one of the oldest cities of Arkadia, was first recorded in the Homeric Catalogue of Ships. In the Archaic period the 9 villages of Tegea joined in a synoicism to form one large city (cf. Mantinea and Sparta). After a long period of struggle, Tegea was forced into the role of a vassal state by Sparta at ca. 560 B.C. It remained under Spartan control until it joined the Arkadian League and fought against Sparta in 362 B.C. At ca. 370 B.C. Tegea constructed its first city walls. During the 3rd century, however, Tegea suffered 3 defeats by the Spartans.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In 222 B.C. Tegea was forced into the Achaean League and it continued to lose political power during the Hellenistic period. The city retained its prosperity and commercial importance, however, and flourished well into the Roman period. At ca. A.D. 395 Tegea was destroyed by the Goths, but was rebuilt under the name Nikli, and became one of the most important Byzantine cities in the Peloponnese.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
      <exploration>&lt;P&gt;G. Fougeres and V. B&eacute;rard excavated in 1888-1889 for the French School. The Temple of Alea Athena was investigated by A. Milchh&ouml;fer in 1879 and by W. D&ouml;rpfeld in 1882: it was excavated by G. Mendel and C. Dugas of the French School between 1900 and 1910. K. Dimakopoulou excavated at the site in 1964-1965.

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;Ancient Tegea, ca 10 km SE of modern Tripolis, extended over a large area on an upland plain that had previously been occupied by 9 smaller villages. It had a city wall from ca. 370 B.C. and, in addition to the agora, theater, stadium and other civic buildings, it was the location of a Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore where many Geometric and Archaic votives have been excavated.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The main sanctuary of ancient Tegea, however, was the Temple of Athena Alea, reputed in ancient times as one of the most important religious centers in Greece. The sanctuary originated in the Geometric period and served throughout antiquity as a famous place of asylum for fugitives and exiles, including a number of former kings of Sparta. The Archaic Temple of Athena was replaced by a new temple in the 4th century B.C. and in the 5th century A.D. a Christian church was built in its cella.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;The palace is a large complex (ca. 104.5 x 88.5 m.) with rooms arranged around a peristyle court. Many of the rooms seem to have served as dining rooms or androns, many with mosaic floors. On the south side of the palace is a circular room, the &quot;Tholos&quot; which the excavator suggests may have served as a shrine and court of judgement. The complex dates to the end of the fourth century B.C. It appears to have been destroyed by fire in the mid 2nd century B.C. and abandoned. An inscription in the &quot;Tholos&quot; of the palace reads &lt;foreign lang=&quot;Greek&quot;&gt;*H*R*A*K*L*H*I *P*A*T*R*W*I*W*I&lt;/foreign&gt;, &quot;(dedicated) to Herakles the Father&quot; &mdash; i.e. the father of the Macedonian royal house.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Nearby are the remains of a theater; a small temple of Eukleia; important defensive walls and gates; and Hellenistic houses.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Beyond the palace a large number of tombs, dating from the 10th to the 2nd century B.C. have been discovered. A huge tumulus, 110 m. in diameter and containing at least three Late Classical/Early Hellenistic vaulted tomb chambers, lies on the western edge of the necropolis. Two of the tombs in this tumulus were found unplundered, and Tomb II has been identified as the tomb of Philip II, father of Alexander the Great. These royal burials, with their well-preserved painted decoration and stunning contents, are among the most spectacular recent discoveries of Greek archaeology.</description>
      <exploration>&lt;P&gt;The earliest excavations were by L. Heuzey and H. Daumet in 1861. Additional excavations were carried out in 1937-1940, 1952-1961, and 1965-1968 by C. Romaios, C. Makaronas, G. Bakalakis, and M. Andronikos. Since 1962 M. Andronikos has conducted excavations, uncovering the royal tombs among other discoveries.&lt;/P&gt;</exploration>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;Located on the remote upper SE slope of a high peak at the N edge of the Lasithi plain, Karphi was a refuge settlement of ca. 150 rectangular adjoining rooms representing an unknown number of individual residences. The settlement was unwalled, but in a naturally defensible position with a stepped entrance at its steep N edge. At the center of the settlement a &quot;Great House&quot; has been identified by its superior construction and the number of finds of bronze artifacts. At the N edge of the settlement, along the cliff edge, is a shrine or temple identified on the basis of an interior altar and ledge for cult objects and finds of terracotta figurines. The figurines follow the earlier Minoan tradition of females in bell-skirts, up-raised arms, and crowns surmounted by birds and disks.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Many stretches of the twisting passages through the settlement were paved in stone. Remains of the settlement extend E across the ridge top saddle that joins the Karphi peak to the summit of Mikre Koprana. Associated tholos tombs are located outside the settlement to the S.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;The earliest settlement at Troy was in the Early Bronze Age at ca. 3000 B.C. This small fortified settlement was destroyed by fire and was followed by Troy II (2500-2200 B.C.), which Schliemann incorrectly believed to have been the city of Priam. Settlement continued throughout the Bronze Age at the site. The latest prehistoric levels are Troy VI (1800-1275 B.C.) and Troy VII (1275-1100 B.C.) and scholars debate which of these levels represent the city of Priam and scene of the Trojan War.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Following the end of the Late Bronze Age there was a 400 year hiatus at the site until it was resettled at ca. 700 B.C. by Greek colonists, possibly from Lesbos or Tenedos. The Early Iron Age city (Troy VIII) was founded with the name Ilion and believed at the time to be the site of Homeric Troy. The city had little political power, but was symbolically important. It was under Persian control from the 6th century B.C. until the liberation of Asia Minor by Alexander the Great in 334 B.C.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In 480 B.C. Xerxes halted at Troy to sacrifice a thousand oxen before crossing the Hellespont into Greece. In 334 B.C. Alexander went to Troy immediately after crossing into Asia Minor to make an offering. Following the death of Alexander in 323 B.C., his successor in Thrace had a new temple of Athena built at the city. Julius Caesar, who believed himself to be a direct descendant of Priam, visited the city and gave it immunity from taxation. In the reign of Augustus the city and the sanctuary of Athena under went a large rebuilding program. Constantine considered Troy as a possible site for his new capital before chosing Byzantium, and as late as A.D. 355 the site was visited by the emperor Julian. By the 4th century A.D., however, the site was little more than a small farming community and by the 12th century A.D. it was completely abandoned.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
      <exploration>&lt;P&gt;Troy was discovered and first excavated by H. Schliemann at the end of the last century. Work was continued by D&ouml;rpfeld and then by C. Blegen.&lt;/P&gt;</exploration>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;From the beginning, the settlements at the site of Troy were fortified. During the Bronze Age the coast line was closer to the low mound of the site and Troy maintained a stratigic maritime advantage due to its position at the opening of the Hellespont. Troy also had access to a large fertile coastal plain for agriculture. By the Hellenistic period the coast line had shifted away due to silting and the nearby city of Alexandria Troas captured the maritime commercial advantage.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the Early Iron Age the Greek colonists repaired and made use of the earlier Bronze Age fortification walls, and the city remained relatively small throughout the Archaic and Classical periods. In the Hellenistic period much of the original settlement area was disturbed by by the construction of a new sanctuary of Athena, a theater, palaestra, and extended city walls.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The city was destroyed in 82 B.C. during the Mithridatic Wars, but rebuilt during the reign of Augustus (27 B.C. - A.D. 14). The Roman rennovations included the reconstruction of the sanctuary of Athena and the addition of odeum, bouleuterion, and other buildings.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;The earliest material from Pergamon indicates that the site was settled as early as the 8th century B.C. Because of its distance from the sea, however, Pergamon was probably not a Greek settlement and little is known about the earlier centuries. The city is first mentioned in history in 399 B.C. and at that time it was in the hands of a local Greek tyrant.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Pergamon emerged as a power during the struggle for territorial control following the death of Alexander the Great in 323 B.C. By the middle of the 3rd century Pergamon had been established as an independent state under the leadership of the Attalid dynasty. The power of the Attalids and the city grew as a result of successful battles against the Gauls of central Anatolia and careful political alliances with Rome.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The peak period of Pergamene power and achievement was reached during the reign of Eumenes II (197-159 B.C.). The kingdom had grown to include most of western Anatolia and was rich in agriculture and industry. Noted industrial exports included textiles, fine pottery, and &quot;Pergamene paper&quot; or parchment. The last industry developed when Ptolemy, reportedly jealous of the growing fame of the library in Pergamon, prohibited the export of papyrus from Egypt. Eumenes II enlarged the city of Pergamon to include all of the southern slope and enclosed the city with a new and stronger fortification wall. In addition to the major new constructions in the lower city Eumenes also commissioned the Great Altar of Zeus and Athena, the theater, and the new library in the upper city.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the 2nd century B.C. Pergamon rivalled Athens and Alexandria as centers of Hellenic culture. The city possessed one of the greatest libraries of antiquity, monumental gymnasia, and numerous religious sanctuaries, including the Asklepion outside the city walls. Pergamon was a haven for noted philosophers and artists and was the center of a major movement in Hellenistic sculpture. The Attalids supported the arts and learning in Pergamon and elsewhere and made major donations, such as the Stoa of Attalos II in Athens.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The last Attalid ruler, Attalos III, bequeathed the kingdom of Pergamon to Rome in 133 B.C. During Roman rule the prosperity of Pergamon continued and the city had a period of commercial expansion. The city itself expanded to the plain S and W of the acropolis across the flat land now occuppied by modern Bergama.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After a slight decline in the 1st century A.D. Pergamon went through a second period of greatness in the 2nd century A.D. New monumental structures were completed, including the large (ca. 300 x 100 m) sanctuary to the Egyptian gods in the center of the Roman city. The Sanctuary of Asklepios grew in fame and was considered one of the most famous therapeutic and healing center of the Roman world. Galen, after Hippocrates the most famous physician of antiquity, was born at Pergamon and received his early training at the Asklepion.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By the end of the 2nd century A.D. Pergamon had become an important Christian center and the monumental Temple of Serapis in the sanctuary to the Egyptian gods was converted to a church. Economical decline, however, followed the weakening of the Pax Romana and Pergamon lost much of its importance. In A.D. 716 the city was sacked by the Arabs and as a minor provincial center changed hands several times in the Medieval period.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
      <exploration>&lt;P&gt;Excavations by the German Archaeological Institute have been conducted almost continuously since 1878. During the earliest work at the end of the last century major art works, including the entire Altar of Zeus and Athena, were brought to Berlin.&lt;/P&gt;</exploration>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;The oldest section of Pergamon, the acropolis or upper city, sits on an impressive steep ridge between two tributaries of the Caicus river. The ridge is naturally fortified on all but the S side which slopes down to the Caicus valley floor. The Caicus valley provides access from Pergamon to the Aegean coast and the port town of Elaea in the W and the Persian Royal Road to the E.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The upper city, which was fortified in the 4th or 3rd century B.C. contains the 3rd century Sanctuary of Athena, the oldest cult center of the city as well as palace quarters, barracks, and arsenals. In the 2nd century B.C. the 10,000 seat theater, the library adjacent to the Sanctuary of Athena, and the Great Altar of Zeus and Athena were added. In the 2nd century A.D. the monumental Trajaneum was erected on what must have been an earlier unknown cult center. From the upper agora a paved main street leads S and downslope to the middle city.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The city of Pergamon began to extend down the S slope in the 3rd century B.C. and during the 2nd century a massive building program completely transformed the entire lower slope. The major construction in the area was the gigantic gymnasium complex which extended down three large terraces linked by vaulted stairways and passages. The complex encorporated three open training courts, a covered track or xystus, a small theater or odeum, several shrines, and two large baths. Other major sections of the middle city included the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore and, below the gymnasium along the main street leading to the Eumenes' Gate, the lower agora. North and E of the gymnasium massive terraces support the streets and houses of the residential quarter. In the first half of the 2nd century B.C. Eumenes II strengthened the entire fortification system of Pergamon and enclosed all of the middle city, which extended almost to the base of the south slope, within the new walls.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;During the Roman Imperial period the city continued to expand southward and spread over the plain and the area occuppied by modern Bergama. The large Sanctuary of the Egyptian Gods (the &quot;Kizil Avlu&quot;), numerous bridges, and remains of the Roman stadium, theater, and amphitheater remain visible today.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Traditionally, Androklos, a son of the legendary king Kodros of Athens, led a colony of Ionian Greeks to found Ephesos at the mouth of the Cayster river. The Ionians apparently settled peacefully among the local inhabitants and integrated the worship of Artemis into the local cult of Cybele. The new fortified Greek city was established on the shore at the base of Mount Pion, ca. 1 km W of the Cybele cult center.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The foundation date for the Cybele sanctuary is unknown, but the transformation of Cybele into an Asian Artemis appears to have been completed by as early as the 8th century B.C. The sanctuary, which became known as the Artemision, underwent three building phases between the 8th and 6th centuries B.C. before the Archaic temple of ca. 560-500 B.C. was constructed. The Archaic temple of Artemis was the largest building in the Archaic Greek world and the first large structure to be built entirely in marble.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In 356 B.C. the temple was burnt by a madman. The Ephesians rebuilt the temple in the original dimensions, but on a higher base. The greatest sculptors of the age worked on the temple and it was completed nearly a century later. The temple of Artemis was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. The sanctuary of Artemis was plundered in A.D. 263 by the Goths and extensively quarried for building stone in the early Christian era.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The city of Ephesos, which benefited from its association with the sanctuary and from its favorable position at the center of the W coast of Asia Minor, flourished as a result of trade between the Aegean and the large asian cities of the interior.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the 7th century B.C. Ephesos fell to the Cimmerians and in the 6th century it came under the control of the Lydians. King Croesus demolished the city walls and forced the inhabitants of Ephesos to build a new unfortified city farther inland. After the fall of Croesus, Ephesos, with the rest of Ionia, became part of the Persian Empire. Following the defeat of the Persians in Greece, Ephesos became a member of the Delian League. The King's Peace of 386 B.C. caused the city to revert to Persian control for a short period until the conquest of Asia Minor by Alexander the Great.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At ca. 290 B.C. Lysimachos compelled the Ephesians to abandon their site and to construct a new fortified city at the shore, in the area between Mounts Pion and Coressus. Lysimachos' city included over 9 km of fortification walls, a sheltered harbor, and extensive wharves and warehouses. Today the site is 5 km from the sea due to the silting action of the Cayster river.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;During the 3rd and 2nd centuries B.C. control of Ephesos changed hands frequently. In 133 B.C. it was part of the Attalid kingdom given over to Rome. Ephesos became the capital of the Roman Province of Asia and one of the largest and most important commercial centers of the eastern Empire. Ephesos was granted special honors by Rome and many monumental buildings and architectural adornments were added to the city. Through Roman engineering the harbor was kept open despite the silting of the river.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the 3rd and 4th centuries A.D. the prosperity of Ephesos declined with the decline of Roman power. Plague and raids by the Goths were followed by raids by the Arabs. The harbor was allowed to silt up and trade was greatly weakened. In the 4th century A.D. Christianity was adopted as the state religion and two important early Church councils were held at Ephesos in the 5th century A.D. By the 6th century A.D. most of the inhabitants had moved to the more secure position at Ayasluk, near the former site of the Artemision.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
      <exploration>&lt;P&gt;The location of the Artemision was discovered by J.T. Wood in the mid 19th century and his work there was followed by Hogarth at the beginning of the 20th century. Austrian excavations at the Artemision and at Ephesos began first in 1896 and continue today.&lt;/P&gt;</exploration>
      <periods>&lt;P&gt;Archaic&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Classical&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Hellenistic&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Roman&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Byzantine&lt;/P&gt;</periods>
      <physical>&lt;P&gt;Ephesos was originally established at the base of Mount Pion, on a natural harbor at the delta of the Cayster river. The second site, the unfortified late Archaic and Classical city was farther inland, closer to the location of modern Selcuk. With the exception of some Archaic graves, there has been little exploration of the Archaic or Classical settlements.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The location selected by Lysimachos at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. is represented by the ruins visible today. Hellenistic Ephesos was planned on a grid system at the W base of Mt. Pion and in the narrow valley S of Mt. Pion and NW of Mt. Koressos. The city was enclosed by massive fortification walls reaching a height of 10 m and extending over a distance of 9.6 km. The ancient harbor lay to the NW of the city center and was approached by a broad, straight avenue. This 600 m long avenue was provided, at the start of the 5th century A.D., with flanking porticoes and mosaic sidewalks, marble pavement, and 100 street lamps.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The harbor area was dominated by a large gymnasium and bath complex, warehouses, and a long narrow building, thought to have been a grain exchange. The city's center, at the E end of the long avenue (the Arcadian Way), contained the 24,000 seat theater, the commercial or lower agora, the Library of Celsus, and possibly the official residence of the Roman governor.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A non-aligned major street (the Street of Curetes or the Marble Way) follows a winding route between Mt. Pion and Mt. Koressos to the upper agora (the State Agora) and the Magnesian Gate. This section of the city contained the East Gymnasium, Baths of Varius, the Bouleuterion, the Prytaneion, and most of the temples, monuments, fountains and other public buildings of the city. In the main part of the city, between the lower and the upper agora, the Street of Curetes separates luxurious residential houses to the SW from the brothel and public baths and latrine to the the NE. At the extreme N of the city was a fourth large gymnasium and the Roman stadium.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;On the lower NE slope of Mt. Pion, beyond the city walls, are a rustic sanctuary of the Mother Goddess and the Christian shrine of the Seven Sleepers. From the Magnesian Gate a sacred way led to the Artemision, 1 km to the NE. The structures at this sanctuary consisted of the monumental temple to Artemis and a single large altar.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Originally a Carian city on the edge of Ionian territory, Latmus became a member of the Delian League in the 5th century B.C. In the 4th century B.C. Mausolos of Halikarnassos captured the city by trickery and fortified it with a circuit wall.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At the beginning of the 3rd century B.C., with the removal of Persian influence in Anatolia, a new city of Latmus was established ca. 1 km W of the old city. At this time, or slightly earlier under the Hellenizing policy of Mausolos, the city received the new name of Herakleia.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The city was always overshadowed by nearby Miletus which was more favorably located at the opening of the Latmian gulf. Although new construction continued at Herakleia during the Hellenistic and Roman periods, the silting of the Meander river closed the gulf and by the 1st century B.C. the harbor of Herakleia no longer had access to the Aegean Sea and the gulf before Herakleia was transformed into the large freshwater lake Bafa.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The city of Latmus-Herakleia was well known in antiquity for its association with the myth of Endymion, a demi-god who chose to avoid death and old age by sleeping forever in a cave on sacred Mt. Latmus. In the 7th century A.D. communities of Christian monks who had fled Arabia were drawn to Herakleia and Lake Barfa by the plentiful supply of fish and the many caves and natural wild character of the terrain. The Endymion myth was given a Christian interpretation and many pilgrims visited the region.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;Located on the S slopes of Mount Latmus and ca. 25 km W of Miletus, Heralkeia under Latmos was originally a port city at the extreme SE corner of the Latmian gulf. As the Meander silted its delta a swamp developed at Miletus and the freshwater lake of Barfa was formed at the SE.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The 3rd century B.C. city of Heralkeia (a refoundation of the earlier city of Latmos 1 km to the E) had a circuit of well-built fortification walls that extended over 6 km in length and ran from the fortified harbor northwards into the rugged upper slopes of Mt. Latmus. The walls supported 65 towers and numerous gates and postern gates. They are among the best preserved in the ancient world and details of parapets, windows, foundation cuttings in bedrock, and even roofs can still be seen today.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The new city was planned in the Hippodamian grid system with major streets running due N from the fortified harbor. At the center of the city is a rectangular agora (60 x 130 m) with a two story row of shops still preserved along the southern edge. East of the agora is the bouleuterion. The main temple of the city, the temple of Athena, is one of the few structures not aligned to the city grid. It sits on a prominent rocky spur to the west of the agora. The area of the city N of the agora is less well known, but remains of three temples, a Roman bath, a Roman theater, and a nymphaeum have been identified. South of the agora, on a rise overlooking the lake is another structure not aligned to the grid. This is a sanctuary with a SW facing building that was almost certainly dedicated to Endymion. The unusual horseshoe-shaped rear wall of the cella incorporates sections of natural bedrock and may well be a reflection of Endymion's cave.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The original settlement of Latmos, 1 km to the E served the later city as a necropolis, as did all the area S and E of the 3rd century city walls of Herakleia.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <site_type>Sanctuary</site_type>
      <description>&lt;P&gt;Labraunda was a major sanctuary of the Carians, dedicated to Zeus Stratius or Zeus Labraundos. The original site of the 7th century B.C. may have been simply a sacred grove of plane trees. In the 5th century B.C. the Hecatomnids, Mausolus followed by his brother Idrieus, adopted the cult and brought about a great embellishment of the sanctuary, including the erection of the 1st temple of Zeus, the Propylaeae and other major buildings. Although the sanctuary was in the territory of Mausolus' capital city of Mylasa, it enjoyed a measure of independence and its priests were responsible for the administration of the temple lands.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After the Hectomnid transformation of the sanctuary, which may have included the addition of a royal summer residence on the site and the fortified refuge above the sacred precinct, there was almost no change to the sanctuary until the 1st century A.D. when a number of buildings, including the W stoa, the well-house and 2 baths, were added. In the 4th century A.D. much of the W part of the sanctuary was destroyed by fire, but the site continued to be occupied and an early Byzantine church was built of reused material at the E end of the site. The church was destroyed by fire in the 11th century A.D.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;The site occupies a series of artificial terraces 600 meters above sea level on the S slope of a mountain overlooking the plain of Milas. It is linked by a 7.5 m wide, paved Sacred Way to the city of Mylasa (modern Milas), 13 km to the S. The artificial terraces at Labraunda, connected by ramps and stairways, extend from the propylaeae and courtyard at the SE corner of the site to just below the summit of the mountain. The building remains (dating chiefly to the 5th century B.C. and 1st century A.D.) include the temple of Zeus, 3 androns or male club buildings, 2 stoas, 2 Roman baths, several priests' residences, a nymphaium or well-house, and possibly a treasury. Remains to the SE may be the fountain and pool for bejeweled, tame fish reportedly maintained at the sanctuary, possibly in connection with an oracle. Above the main sanctuary are the remains of a stadium, and a fortified refuge occupies the summit. Around the area of the sanctuary and along the 13 km long Sacred Way are many tombs and sepulchral monuments.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;A Carian city, originally known as Kyromos or Hyromos, it acquired the Hellenic name Euromos in the 4th century B.C. In its earlier history the city was independent and was of some size and importance, but it was overshadowed by the nearby city of Mylasa.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Euromos was a member of the Delian League in the mid 5th century B.C. and seems to have remained independent until ca. 167 B.C. when Mylasa revolted from Rhodian control and asserted power over Euromos territory. Euromos then formed alliances with Rome, Rhodes, and Iasos and prospered during the Hellenistic and Roman periods.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;Located ca. 20 km SE of Lake Bafa and ca. 12 km N of ancient Mylasa, Euromos stood on flat ground, encircled by a wall of Classical to Hellenistic date. The city had a theater and a rectangular agora with colonnaded stoas on each side. Just outside the city walls, to the S is the sanctuary and temple of Zeus, one of the best preserved temples in Turkey. The present temple, which is at least the 3rd built on that location is in the Corinthian style and dates to the 2nd century A.D., but it was never completed. The temenos itself dates back to as early as the 6th century B.C.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;According to tradition, Iasos was colonized, possibly in the 9th or 8th century B.C., by Dorian Greeks from Argos with the support of the nearby Ionian city of Miletus. Archaeological evidence, however, shows that the site was already occupied in the Early Bronze Age. Minoan and Mycenaean remains indicate continued occupation in later periods. Iasos probably supported the Ionian cities against the Persians, and in the 5th century B.C. it was a member of the Delian League. As an ally of Athens, Iasos was attacked by Sparta and Persia in 412 B.C. and sacked. There is some evidence that Iasos was again attacked by Sparta in 404 B.C. and that all the inhabitants were slaughtered or sold into slavery.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After Spartian power in the Aegean was destroyed by Conon in 394 B.C., Iasos was rebuilt, possibly with the aid of Knidos, and it joined a league of Aegean states that included Ephesos, Rhodes, Samos, and Byzantium. Following the Peace of Antalkides in 386 B.C., Iasos came under the control of Mausolos and the satrapy of Caria. Iasos was later liberated by Alexander the Great, but in 125 B.C. it, along with all of Caria, became part of the Roman province of Asia. Prosperity continued throughout the Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine periods and many of the remains visible today date from the later periods.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;Iasos occupies a S projecting headland of ca. 800 x 200 m on the gulf of Mendelia, NE of the Halikarnassos peninsula. From the highest point, near the center of the headland, the land slopes away to the flat isthmus joining the mainland. The necropolis and a Roman aqueduct are located on the low land N and E of the isthmus. E of the headland is a small harbor and W is a smaller and well-protected harbor. The W harbor had a mole and could be closed by a chain. The high land W of the harbor was protected by a 3 km long fortification wall with numerous towers and sally ports. This land wall, which was never completed, enclosed a large plateau and may have been built shortly before 412 B.C. by the Iasos ruler Amorges as a garrison or refuge center.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A 2nd fortification wall encircled the city of Iasos on the headland E of the harbor. The city's fortifications may also date to the 5th century B.C., but were extensively rebuilt in later periods. The main gate of the city, located at the isthmus and head of the harbor, opened directly onto the agora, just inside the city walls. Excavations have found earlier 9th and 8th century graves beneath the agora, indicating that the earlier city had been smaller.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The civic center of Iasos, including the bouleuterion, gymnasium, and theater lie in the N quarter of the city, between the agora at the N and the acropolis near the center of the headland. Streets and private houses are found S and E of the acropolis. A sanctuary of Demeter and Kore and a S city gate are at the S tip of the headland and a sanctuary of Artemis is located in the N corner of the city, near the agora. The remains on the acropolis have been greatly disturbed by the construction of a fortress by the Knights of Rhodes in the Middle Ages.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;According to tradition, Miletus was first founded as a trading post by colonists from the Cretan city of Milatos sometime before 1400 B.C. The site appears to have passed into Mycenaean control and finally by the end of the Late Bronze Age into Carian hands. Miletus was the only Ionian city mentioned by Homer, who records that the Carian-led Miletians fought against the Greeks at Troy. Archaeological excavations at Kalabak Tepe, to the SW of the site, verify the early Minoan and Mycenaean presence.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The refounding of Miletus, early in the Iron Age, was traditionally credited to Neleus, a son of the legendary King Kodros of Athens. Neleus and the Ionian Greeks occupied the city, slaughtered the Carian males, and took the women as mates.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Because of its important maritime location and its proximity to the famous sanctuary of Apollo at Didyma, Miletus prospered as a trading center. During the 8th and 7th centuries B.C., Miletus established over 90 colonies throughout the E Aegean; from Naucratis in Egypt to Sinope on the Black Sea. The trade and international contacts of Miletus brought a prosperity and cosmopolitan character to the city. In the Archaic period Miletus was a major center for the early development of Greek science and philosophy. By the 6th century B.C. the city had grown in size and extended from the original site on Kalabak Tepe to the area of the harbor of the Lions. The city was renouned throughout the Greek world and was the most important of the 12 cities in the Panionian League.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Although Miletus seems to have had special privileges under Persian rule, it took an active part in the Ionian revolt of 500-494 B.C. Following the Greek defeat at the naval battle of Lade in 494 B.C., the Persians destroyed Miletus and killed or enslaved all the inhabitants. At the same time the sanctuary of Apollo at Didyma was also plundered and destroyed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In 480 B.C. Greek victory over the Persians restored freedom to the Ionian cities. Miletus joined the Delian League and regained much of its former status. The previous prosperity of Miletus, however, had been based on its sea trade which was hindered by the rise of Athenian naval supremacy.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In 386 B.C. the Ionian cities again came under Persian control as a result of the Kings' Peace settlement. In 334 B.C., in the course of freeing the Ionian cities from Persian rule, Alexander the Great defeated the Persian garrison at Miletus. During the Hellenistic period Miletus passed under the control of a number of dynasties, finally being presented to the Romans by the last Attalid king.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Under Roman rule, Miletus had the status of a free city and continued to flourish until the 4th century A.D. when the silting of the Maeander delta closed the harbors and created a swamp at the former shore line. Miletus had always been predominately a maritime city and the loss of its harbors terminated the life of the city. In the Byzantine period a fortress was constructed on the upper ruins of the theater.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
      <exploration>&lt;P&gt;German excavations began at Miletus at the end of the 19th century and continue to the present.&lt;/P&gt;</exploration>
      <periods>&lt;P&gt;Late Bronze Age&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Archaic&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Classical&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Hellenistic&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Roman&lt;/P&gt;</periods>
      <physical>&lt;P&gt;The original topographical position of Miletus was on a peninsula at the S side of the opening to the Latmian Gulf. The natural harbors of the site gained additional shelter from the offshore island of Lade to the W. In contrast to Ephesus, Smyrna, and other Anatolian ports situated at the opening of broad valleys leading to the interior, Miletus had mountainous terrain at its back. The city was therefore more completely maritime in character and when silt deposited by the Maeander River closed the gulf and extended the shore line (today it is ca. 10 km beyond Miletus), the economy collapsed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The early Archaic city of Miletus appears to have been centered around the temple of Athena, located between the southwestern Athena harbor and the central Theater harbor. After the Persian destruction in the beginning of the 5th century B.C. the city rebuilt and made extensive use of the grid system developed by the Milesian architect Hippodamos. The city center moved toward the NE, to the area between the base of the Lions harbor and E of the Theater harbor.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The remains of the Hellenistic and Roman city cover all of the flat area of the peninsula N of the Kalabak Tepe and were enclosed by a city wall completed in the 4th century B.C. The larger Athena and Theater harbors were backed by the city wall, but the narrower, more defendable Lion harbor allowed an opening in the city wall. This was sealed by a chain in time of danger.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In addition to the three W harbors at Miletus ships could also be landed on the east side of the city. The Lion harbor was the principal port of the city and was surrounded on three sides by quays, warehouses, and shops. At the S base of the Lion harbor is the North agora and the sanctuary of Apollo. Below the North agora is the South agora (the largest agora in the Greek world: 164 x 196 m) and the civic center of the city. Located here are the bouleuterion, major temples and hero shrines, the nymphaeum, and the starting point of the Didyma sacred way.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;West of the South agora are the Baths of Faustina (the only structure not aligned to the city grid system) and the West gymnasium. Farther W, between the Athena and Theater harbors is the West agora, the latest of the city's three market places. The West agora is immediately N of the temple of Athena. North of the Theater harbor is the theater of Miletus, originally built in the 4th century B.C. and enlarged in the Hellenistic and Roman periods to a final capacity of 15,000 seats.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;According to tradition, Dorian colonists from Troezen settled at Halikarnassos early in the Iron Age. They apparently occupied the territory peacefully and intermarried with the local Carian population. Halikarnassos was one of the three mainland cities of the Dorian Hexapolis. By the 5th century B.C., however, it had come under the cultural influence of Ionia to the N and no longer belonged to the Dorian Hexapolis. The city was a composit of Carian and Ionian elements and the earliest inscriptions from the city show no remaining traces of a Dorian dialect.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After the Persian conquest in the 6th century B.C., Halikarnassos was ruled by a Carian dynasty centered at Mylasa. In 480 B.C. queen Artemisia I, of Carian and Greek descent, personally led her forces on the side of the Persians at the battle of Salamis and was one of Xerxes' most trusted advisors. Halikarnassos became a member of the Delian League as a result of the Persian defeat. It again came under Persian control after the King's Peace of 386 B.C.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Mausolus became satrap and king of Caria in 377 B.C. and was one of the most notable of the Carian rulers. He moved the capital of Caria from Mylasa to Halikarnassos on the N shore of the gulf of Kos, extended and strengthened the borders of Carian territory and began a program to Hellenize his subjects. Halikarnassos itself was enclosed by over 5 km of fortification walls and the population greatly enlarged by the forced depopulation of other towns on the Myndos peninsula. The monumental building program of Mausolus included a marble palace on the east side of the harbor and the erection of his tomb in the center of the city. After the death of Mausolus in 353 B.C., his wife-sister, Artemisia II, completed the tomb and defeated the city of Rhodes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Halikarnassos was one of the few Anatolian cities to resist the advance of Alexander the Great. In 334 B.C. Alexander sacked the city and appointed Ada, an exiled member of the ruling Carian dynasty as the new queen. During the Hellenistic period Caria was ruled in turn by the Ptolemies, the Seleucids, the Macedonians, and the Rhodians. Under Roman rule the city was independent, but not exceptionally prosperous. The city suffered under Verres in 80 B.C. and again under Brutus and Cassius ca. 40 B.C. During the peace of the Roman Empire Halikarnassos again prospered and it remained an important port into the medieval period.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Halikarnassos is most noted for the tomb of Mausolus The Mausoleum was enhanced by the leading Greek sculptors of the century and was considered one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Halikarnassos was also the birthplace of Herodotus, the &quot;father of history&quot; and the historian Dionysius.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
      <exploration>&lt;P&gt;The Mausoluem remained intact until the medieval period when, perhaps following an earthquake, the stones of the structure were reused in the construction of the castle of the Knights of St. John in the 15th century A.D. The location of the tomb was rediscovered and investigated by Sir Charles Newton in 1856. Modern excavations at the Mausoleum began in 1966 by a Danish archaeological mission.&lt;/P&gt;</exploration>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;In the 4th century B.C. Halikarnassos was a well fortified large city arranged in ampitheater form around its natural harbor. The city was laid out on a grid with major streets leading N from the harbor to the heights of the acropolis. The harbor was enclosed by moles and a canal led to a second, secret harbor which is believed to have been to the E of the main harbor.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The palace of Mausolus was located on the peninsula to the E of the harbor and the Mausoleum was at the center of the city, N of the agora and the harbor. Additional graves of the Hellenistic and Roman period are located within the city walls on the S slope of the acropolis, beyond the theater.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <site_type>Sanctuary</site_type>
      <description>&lt;P&gt;At an early date, possibly before 800 B.C., the 12 main Ionian cities formed the Panionic League which had religious and cultural importance, but no political or military function. The League established its center at a site which may have already been sacret to the small city of Melia and dedicated the new sanctuary to Poseidon Heliconius. The sanctuary served as the meeting place of the League and as the location for the Paionia, a regularly held festival in honor of Poseidon. The city of Priene managed the sanctuary and had some privileges in appointment of priests.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;During the Persian period activities of the League and the sanctuary were limited and for a time the Panionia was held in the neighborhood of Ephesus for saftey. After the conquests of Alexander, the Paionia was revived at its origianl sanctuary and continued to be held throughout the Roman period. The cultural and religious significance of the Panionium sanctuary and the festival, however, never regained the importance they held before the 5th century B.C.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
      <exploration>&lt;P&gt;The location of the Panionium was first suggested by the discovery of an inscription in the area in 1673. T. Wiegand discovered the actual location of the sanctuary at the end of the 19th century and the site was partially excavated by a German team in 1958.&lt;/P&gt;</exploration>
      <periods>&lt;P&gt;Archaic&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Classical&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Hellenistic&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Roman&lt;/P&gt;</periods>
      <physical>&lt;P&gt;The sanctuary is on a low hill on the N slope of Mt. Mycale, overlooking the sea. It was in the territory of Priene, which is ca. 5 km due S on the opposite slope of the mountain, and linked to that city by a paved road.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The sanctuary was enclosed by a temenos wall and at the center of the site was a rectangualr altar of ca. 17.50 m by 4.25 m. There were no temples or other buildings at the sanctuary, but a small theater or odeum consisting of 11 semicircular rows of seats cut into bedrock is located ca. 50 m SW of the altar at the foot of the small hill. This was almost certainly the meeting place for the delegates of the Ionian League. There is also a large cave above the meeting place, but it has not been shown to have had a cult function.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <site_type>Fortified city</site_type>
      <description>&lt;P&gt;Akragas claimed the legendary Daedalus as its founder, but in fact the city seems to have been established by a group of Rhodian and Cretan colonists from the city of Gela at ca. 582 B.C. The settlers named the city after the river along its eastern side. Under the tyrant Phalaris, ca. 570 B.C., the city began to expand its territory and by the end of the reign of Theron, a century later, the city state had reached the height of its military and political power.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Theron had led the city to victory over the Carthaginians in 480 B.C. and initiated a major building program in Akragas which included an extensive water system designed by the architect Phaiax. The city continued to prosper until the end of the 5th century B.C. In 406, after a siege of eight months, Akragas was conquered and completely destroyed by Carthage. the city remained abandoned until ca. 340 B.C. when Timoleon, the Corinthian established at Syracuse, defeated the Carthaginians and restored independence to the Sicilian cities. Timoleon rebuilt Akragas and repopulated it with displaced Akragasians and immigrants from Elea.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In 276 B.C. Akragas again fell under the control of Carthage, but after several sieges of the city, Rome gained control in 210 B.C. The Romans enslaved the inhabitants and repopulated the city which thereafter enjoyed peace and prosperity under Roman rule. Commerce and industry advanced and the port at Emporium flourished. During the early Christian period the city quickly declined and it was little more than a village by the time of the Arab invasion in A.D. 827.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;Akragas occupied the top of a ridge between the confluence of the Hypsas and Akragas rivers, ca. 5 km inland from the Sicilian SW coast. The slope of the ridge is abrupt in three dircetions, but more gentle to the S side which leads down to the Hypsas valley. The acropolis occupied the highest and narrowest part of the ridge at the NW. This was also the steepest area of the ridge and the acropolis was not walled. Southeast of the acropolis the ridge top broadens and slopes gently away to the S. This area of approximately 1 km square was enclosed by a strong fortification wall of ca. 10 km in length and contained the main part of the city. Recent excavations in the ancient residential area have shown that the Hellenistic and Roman city was laid out on a rectangular grid plan that seems to overlay an earlier grid system of the 5th century B.C. The regular grid system of the earlier city streets may have been established during the extensive building program carried out at the beginning of the 5th century B.C. and coincide with the design of aqueducts and underground water transfer and storage system built by the architect Phaiax.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;South of the main area of the city, the city wall runs along the southern edge of the ridge top. Just inside the city wall and also arranged along the southern edge of the ridge plateau are the major sanctuaries and temples of the city. The temples of Hera, Concord, Herakles, Olympian Zeus, and Hephaistos, as well as the sanctuary of Demeter and the Chthonic Deities and other religious shrines are arranged along the southern boundary of the city.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The central city gate (Gate IV or the Golden Gate) opens near the center of the southern wall on the temple ridge. From this gate an ancient road continued down slope to the Hypsas valley, passing additional religious centers, including the sanctuary of Asklepios, and continued on to the city's harbor at Emporium.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Established by colonists from Andros in the Archaic period, the city supported the Persians in 490 and 480 B.C. and willingly aided Xerxes in the construction of a canal across the Akte peninsula. Akanthos was later a member of the Delian League and supported Athens in the Peloponnesian War. After the Peace of Nikias, Akanthos gained some degree of independence until it came under Macedonian control in the 4th century B.C. The city was plundered by the Romans ca A.D. 200, but its port continued to function.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Poseidonia was established and fortified by Greek colonists from the city of Sybaris, farther S, in the 7th century B.C. At ca. 400 B.C. the city was conquered by the Lucanians who renamed it Paiston or Paistos. In 273 B.C. Rome established a colony at the city and latinized the name to Paestum. During the Roman period the prosperity of the city began to decline due to the silting of the Sele river which turned the area swampy and caused it to become infested with malaria. By the early Christian period the city was reduced to the size of a small village and in the 9th century A.D. it was finally abandoned. The location of the site was forgotten and not rediscovered until a road was constructed through the swamp in the middle of the 18th century.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;Paestum was established on the coast at the edge of the Sele plain, ca. 10 km S of the Heraion at Foce del Sele. The site was well chosen for its agricultural potential and the possibility for maritime trade.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The city was enclosed in ca. 5 km of fortification walls and laid out on a grid system. In its design, the central zone of the city was reserved for religious and public buildings. From a central agora, or forum, the major north-south street, the paved Via Sacra, led N to the temenos of Athena, which also included the temple of Ceres. The street continued on to the N city gate. The Via Sacra ran S from the agora to the city's sanctuary of Hera, which included the major temples dedicated to Poseidon and Hera, and a number of smaller temples, treasuries, and altars. The paved street continued from the S religious precinct to the S city gate. In the area of the agora were located additional religious buildings and the major public buildings, including the bouleutron, curia, gymnasium, baths, and the ampitheater. The residental and commercial quarters extended E and W of the central public zone of the city.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Greek colonists, possibly from Pylos, founded the city, originally called Metabum, in the 7th century B.C. Shortly thereafter the settlement was destroyed by the Samnites and then reestablished by Greek colonists from Achaea. Because of its good location for trade and the rich fertility of the surrounding territory the city grew in prosperity. Metapontum came under Roman control during the Pyrrhic War. In the 2nd Punic War the city allied itself with the Carthaginians and soon afterwards appears to have been abandoned. The most famous citizen of Metapontum was Pythagoras who came to teach here after being expelled from the city of Croton, and remained until his death.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

The city was built at the site of an existing local settlement and was laid out on a rectangular grid system enclosed by a fortification wall of ca. 6 km in length. Metapontum had a small artificial harbor linked to the city by a canal. Within the city were an agora, theater, temples and a sanctuary of Apollo Lykeios. The sanctuary of Hera was located outside the city walls, ca. 3 km to the NE. The temple of Hera at the sanctuary, the so-called Tavole Palatine, is one of the best preserved monuments of Magna Graecia. North of Metapontum the agricultural land of the Greek inhabitants was divided by a rectangular grid system into a complex of individual farmsteads.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;In 734 B.C. Corinthians, led by Archias, overcame a local Sicel settlement on the island of Ortygia and established the colony of Syracuse. The island, forming the N side of the Great Harbor and with its own source of fresh water, the spring of Arethusa, remained the citadel of Syracuse. The city, however, soon extended to the mainland, and in the mid 6th century B.C., Ortygia was connected to the mainland by a causeway.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the course of the 5th century B.C. the wealth, cultural development, and political power of Syracuse rivalled Athens itself. In 485 B.C., Gelon, the tyrant of Gela, who had gained control over most of Sicily, seized Syracuse and made it his capital. In 480 B.C. Gelon led the Greeks in a victory over the Carthaginians at Himera. Gelon's brother, who succeeded him, defeated the Etruscians in a naval battle in 474 B.C. and ensured the dominance of Syracuse over the entire southwestern Mediterranian basin.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In 415-413 B.C. Syracuse was victorious in a war with Athens. Between 410 and 397 B.C. Syracuse was again victorious over the Carthaginians and renewed its claim to supremacy in the western Mediterranian.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the middle of the 4th century B.C., however, Carthage again invaded Sicily and threatened Syracuse. In 344 B.C., the Corinthian Timoleon was sent to Sicily at the request of the Greek cities there in order to repel the Carthaginians. Timoleon took possession of Syracuse and led the Sicilian Greeks to victory in 339 B.C. Timoleon rebuilt the Greek cities and established democratic governments in each. Syracuse continued to better the Carthaginians in battle and in the 3rd century B.C. became allied with Rome. Later the city attempted to reject the alliance and at ca. 212 B.C., after a two year siege, the Romans conquered Syracuse. The Roman plunder and looting of art from Syracuse is said to have created the first appreciation of Classical Greek art in Rome. Syracuse declined under Roman rule and was finally destroyed by the Saracens in A.D. 878.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;The city of Syracuse is located at the SE corner of Sicily and included the offshore island of Ortygia. Ortygia, which forms the N arm of the natural harbor at Syracuse, was a naturally defensible site with a source of fresh water. It was the position first occupied by the Greek colonists who fortified it, laid out a linear grid pattern of streets, and constructed their earliest sanctuaries, including temples of Athena and Apollo. The narrow island remained a citadel of the city even after it was joined to the mainland at ca. 550 B.C.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In addition to the large deep harbor (Great Harbor) S of the island, the construction of moles formed a small second harbor N of the island. These facilities made Syracuse one of the principal ports of the western Mediterranian. On the mainland W of Ortygia, and extending to the N, was the commercial and administrative center of Syracuse, the district of Achradina. The agora, shops, and public buildings were in this area adjoining the quays and dry docks of the harbors.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;West of Achradina was the district of Neapolis, where the theater, ampitheater, and many of the major monuments were located. Northwest of Achradina and Neapolis was the residential district of Tyche. The slopping terrain of the Tyche district reached up to the plateau of Epipolae, which was a largely undeveloped area of the city. This high ground was, for stratigic reasons, included within the city's defensive walls which extended far to the W, to the fortress of Euryalos. The well-designed fortress was constructed as an independent strong point at the northwestern extreme of the city's defenses where the only level approach to the Epipolae plateau is located. The latest city walls of Syracuse extended for ca. 31 km and were built by Dionysios at the beginning of the 4th century B.C. A major sanctuary of Olympian Zeus is also located at Syracuse, ca. 3 km S of the city, on the banks of the Cyane river.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;The earliest settlement at Bayrakli, ca. 4 km N of later Smyrna, dates to the Early Bronze Age or ca. 2500 B.C. The site was occupied by Aeolian Greeks at ca. 1050 B.C. and, because of its location at the northern boundary of Ionian territory, it soon became essentially an Ionian city. But it was not admitted to the Panionian League until a much later date. The early Greek city had defensive walls by the 9th century B.C. and its Archaic temple of Athena, built at ca. 625 B.C. was the earliest known Greek religious shrine in Anatolia.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Smyrna was prosperious in the 7th century B.C. and may have been the birthplace of Homer. The city was sacked by the Lydian king Alyattes at ca. 600 B.C. and again by the Persians at ca. 545 B.C. During the Classical period Smyra was an unimportant scatter of villages around the former city site and did not belong to the Delian League.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A new city of Smyrna was founded by Alexander the Great between Mount Pagus and the shore in response to advice from an oracle. Smyrna became a prosperous trade center and was known for its architectural beauty in the Hellenistic and Roman periods. Under Roman control the city was favored by different emperors, including Marcus Aurelius, who donated reconstruction funds to the city after the earthquake of A.D. 178.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Smyrna continued to be an important city in the early Christian period and continued to thrive until thereatened by the Arab raids of the 7th century A.D.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
      <exploration>&lt;P&gt;Smyrna was a center for exploration teams of the Society of Dilettani in the mid 18th century A.D. Bayrakli was excavated by a joint British and Turkish team in 1948-1951. The Smyrna agora was excavated by a joint German and Turkish team in 1932-1941.&lt;/P&gt;</exploration>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;The original Early Bronze Age to Archaic period settlement was at Bayrakli, on the NE side of the Gulf of Izmir. Excavations at this site have found, in addition to the remains of an early temple of Athena, the rare remains of houses and city fortification walls dating to the 9th through 7th centuries B.C.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;There is no evidence for a city or single civic center during the Classical period and in the Hellenistic period a new city was founded in the area of modern Izmir, on and below Mount Pagus.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Mount Pagus served as the acropolis and from it defensive walls extended down to the shore. The 2nd century A.D. agora, which is midway between the acropolis and the harbor, has been partially excavted. With the exception of the agora, Roman theater, and sections of the Roman aqueduct, little remains of the ancient city today.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Gela, named for the river that runs beside it, was founded in 689 B.C. by colonists from Rhodes and Crete. Following a difficult struggle with the native inhabitants, the Greeks began to expand their control into western Sicily. By 582 B.C. the city was secure enough to establish a colony at Akragas and to gain political control over much of the western and central portion of the island. At the end of the 6th century the city had extended its control into SE Sicily, and, under the rule of Hippocrates (498-491 B.C.) Gela had reached the peak of its economical and political power.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In 480 B.C., under the rule of Gelon, the city defeated Carthage. Gelon, however, elected to move his seat of power and many of the Geloans to Syracuse. During the rest of the 5th century Gela declined in political importance, but it remained a prosperous cultural center. In 405 B.C. Gela was defeated and the city razed by the Carthaginians. The city was abandoned until the Corinthian Timoleon rebuilt and repopulated the site in 338 B.C.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In 310 B.C. Gela was conquered by Syracuse and was reduced to a military base occupying only the western part of the ridge top. At ca. 284 B.C. Phintias, the tyrant of Akragas, destroyed Gela and removed its inhabitants to the new city he had named after himself. Gela remained deserted until the medieval town of Terranova was built on the site in the 13th century.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
      <exploration>&lt;P&gt;There were some excavations at Gela in 1900 and new excavations were started in 1948 and continue to the present.&lt;/P&gt;</exploration>
      <periods>&lt;P&gt;Archaic&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Classical&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Hellenistic&lt;/P&gt;</periods>
      <physical>&lt;P&gt;The site of Gela occupied the top of a low sandy ridge running parallel and adjacent to the coast just W of the Gela river. The city's acropolis was at the E end of the ridge and the public and private buildings extended off to the W.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In 338 B.C. the new city of Timoleon was built on a grid plan that placed houses and public buildings on terraced terrain to the W and encroached upon the older acropolis area to the E. The rebuilt city was enclosed by new fortification walls (ca. 4 km in length) which encircled the entire ridge top.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The fortification walls at Gela were built in a standard 4th century B.C. manner. A stone wall of ca. 3.5 m in height was capped by an additional 2 m high section of mud brick walling. At Gela the drifting sands made it necessary to twice extend the height of the mud brick upper section of walls until a total height of over 8 m was reached. In the 3rd century B.C., when the city was abandoned, the sand drifts continued to rise until sections of the wall were completely buried. In WW II, naval bombardment exposed this rare example of ancient military architecture and the remains have since been excavated and conserved.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Traditionally said to have been founded by Jason, the leader of the Argonauts, the sanctuary was established by Greek colonists in the 7th century B.C. The Heraion flourished in the Archaic period, but was less active in the 5th and 4th centuries B.C. In the Hellenistic period the site again rose to prominence. During the Roman period the Heraion declined in importance and, following earthquake damage and the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius, it fell into disuse. In the Christian period it became a quarry for building stone. The location of the sanctuary was forgotten until it was rediscovered in 1934.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;At ca. 400 B.C. the Pergamene Asklepieion was established at the existing religious sanctuary of an unknown deity located at a spring ca. 3 km SW of the city. The early Asklepieion consisted of a number of temples, including the first temple of Asklepios Soter, an early treatment building, fountain house, and several altars. In the late Hellenistic period the sanctuary expanded to the S and took the form of a large rectangular court surrounded by stoas, temples, and an enlarged treatment building. A gymnasium and stoa was also constructed to the W of the main complex.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The fame and prestige of the Asklepieion grew rapidly during the Roman period and reached a peak in the 2nd century A.D. when the sanctuary gained the monumental appearance that is reflected in the remains visible today. In addition to the monumental building program of the 2nd century A.D. and the fame of the sanctuary as a spa and healing center, which was second only to the original Asklepieion at Epidauros, the Pergamene Asklepieion was also renouned as the school of Galen, the most famous physician of the Roman period.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Even after the introduction of Christianity at Pergamon, the Asklepieion continued to exist as a medical and healing center.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <periods>&lt;P&gt;Hellenistic&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Roman&lt;/P&gt;</periods>
      <physical>&lt;P&gt;When the Asklepieion was first established at the beginning of the 4th century B.C. the city of Pergamon was located ca. 3 km to the NE. By the time the sanctuary had reached its peak in fame and monumental appearance in the 2nd century A.D. the city of Pergamon had expanded until its SW edge was ca. 500 m from the sanctuary.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A colonnaded and paved sacred way, the Via Tecta, linked the city to the sanctuary. The sacred way reached the center of the E side of the temenos at a forecourt and monumental propylon. Along the eastern side of the sanctuary the library is N of the propylon and the circular temple of Zeus Asklepios (diameter 23.85 m) and the two-story rotunda treatment center (diameter 26.5 m) are aligned S of it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The two-story circular treatment center at the SE corner of the rectangular temenos is counterbalanced by the theater at the NW corner. The other three sides of the large central court (110 x 130 m) of the sanctuary consists of stoas or colonnaded walkways. A complex of luxurious public latrines at the SW corner of the temenos counterbalanced the library at the NE corner. At the center of the W stoa there was an access to the adjoining gymnasium.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A vaulted subterranian passage led from the large treatment center at the SE to the center of the temenos, where the sacred spring formed the nucleus of the sanctuary. The central plaza-like area of the sanctuary also contained other fountains, mud baths, and small temples and altars. It was at the nucleus of the temenos, in the area of the sacred spring, that the earlier unknown cult center was located and the original Hellenistic Asklepieion developed.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <site_type>Fortified city</site_type>
      <description>&lt;P&gt;The urban history of Olynthus can be divided into fairly distinct periods. There is an early phase, little known either historically or archaeologically; the rebellion from Athens of 432 BC and the anoikismos (&quot;moving inland&quot;), in which the populations of some of the neighboring Chalcidian cities moved inland to Olynthus to form a larger and more defensible city; the growth of Olynthus and of the Chalcidic state in the fourth century, and finally the destruction of the city by Philip of Macedon in 348 BC.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the Neolithic period there was a small settlement on the South Hill. No Bronze Age remains are preserved on the site, but nearby Agios Mamas was inhabited during that era. Archaic occupation begins in about the seventh century, when a town was founded on the South Hill (&lt;bibl&gt;Olynthus, 5, 15-61&lt;/bibl&gt;).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At some point this town was taken, according to Herodotus, by the Bottiaeans, a local tribe which had been driven here by the Macedonians (&lt;bibl n=&quot;Hdt. 8.127&quot;&gt;Hdt. 8.127&lt;/bibl&gt;). Together with the other towns in the area, Olynthus supplied troops and ships to Xerxes in 480. But during the Persian retreat from Greece in 479 BC, Artabazus besieged and captured the city, suspecting that it would revolt from the King (&lt;bibl n=&quot;Hdt. 8.127&quot;&gt;Hdt. 8.127&lt;/bibl&gt;; &lt;bibl n=&quot;Hdt. 7.122&quot;&gt;Hdt. 7.122&lt;/bibl&gt;). Artabazus probably did not kill all the Bottiaeans living at Olynthus, since they seem to have been an important element of the citizen body later on, and even minted their own coinage in parallel with the Chalcidic. The archaeological remains from this early period, down to the last third of the fifth century, are exclusively concentrated on the South Hill.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In 432 BC, in the face of Athenian aggression, Perdiccas, the king of Macedon, persuaded a number of Chalcidic cities to move inland and form a single, fortified city at Olynthus (&lt;bibl n=&quot;Thuc. 1.58&quot;&gt;Thuc. 1.58&lt;/bibl&gt;). This &lt;foreign lang = &quot;Greek&quot;&gt;a)noikismo/s&lt;/foreign&gt;, or &quot;moving inland,&quot; is generally thought to have been the impetus behind the expansion of the old town of Olynthus on the South Hill onto the broad, flat-topped hill to the north, and the laying out of a new grid-planned section of the city there. It is thus the most critical single event in the urban history of Olynthus.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At some time before 382, the Chalcidians formed a League with Olynthus as its capital (see &lt;bibl n=&quot;Xen. Hell. 5.2.11-20&quot;&gt;Xen. Hell. 5.2.11-20&lt;/bibl&gt;). Various dates have been proposed, from before 479 BC, to 432 BC, to the end of the fifth century. The nature of this League, whether a true confederacy of independent poleis or a single unitary state with a single set of laws and citizenship, is also debated (see &lt;bibl&gt;Olynthus, 9, 115&lt;/bibl&gt;; &lt;bibl&gt;Zahrnt 1971, 80-84&lt;/bibl&gt;).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Olynthus was sacked and burned by Philip of Macedon in 348 BC, and this destruction is responsible for the unusually fine preservation of the houses and their contents (&lt;bibl n=&quot;Dem. 9.11&quot;&gt;Dem. 9.11&lt;/bibl&gt;; &lt;bibl n=&quot;Dem. 9.26&quot;&gt;Dem. 9.26&lt;/bibl&gt;; &lt;bibl n=&quot;Dem. 19.267&quot;&gt;Dem. 19.267&lt;/bibl&gt;; &lt;bibl n=&quot;Diod. Sic. 16.52ff.&quot;&gt;Diod. Sic. 16.52ff.&lt;/bibl&gt;). A number of houses showed evidence of intense burning; most contained large numbers of objects still in situ on the floors. Evidence of the siege and fighting at the walls and in the city was quite widespread: slingbullets and arrowheads, many bearing the names of Philip and his generals, were found throughout the site, particularly on the east side of the South Hill.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A small area of the site at the north end of the North Hill was reoccupied after 348 BC: early Hellenistic coins were found in considerable numbers there, as well as in the public buildings which were apparently robbed by the late settlers. There has been some doubt about how complete the abandonment was in recent years, and it has been claimed that most of the site was reoccupied after Philip's destruction. This author's analysis of the coins and other data from the site, however, suggests that while a small area was undoubtedly reoccupied, the greater part of the site was definitively abandoned.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
      <exploration>&lt;P&gt;The site was excavated in four seasons between 1928 and 1939 by D.M. Robinson. Recent excavations and restorations are being undertaken by Dr. J. Vokotoulou.&lt;/P&gt;</exploration>
      <periods>&lt;P&gt;Neolithic&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Archaic&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Classical&lt;/P&gt;</periods>
      <physical>&lt;P&gt;Olynthus is located between the westernmost and central &quot;fingers&quot; of the Chalcidic peninsula, about 2.5 km. inland from the sea. The country immediately surrounding the city is rolling fields, well drained and plentifully supplied with water. To the north, the Polygyros hills rise to some 3000 feet.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The city was built on two flat-topped hills rising about 30-40 m. above the surrounding plain (the North and South Hills). In addition, houses were built to the east of the two hills, down on the plain in the area known as the &quot;Villa Section.&quot; A narrow ridge extending southwards from the southeast corner of the North Hill is known as the East Spur Hill (ESH). The South Hill was probably occupied as early as the seventh century, and continued to be densely inhabited throughout the life of the town. By contrast, the North Hill was not inhabited until the anoikismos of 432 or shortly thereafter (below).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The western fortification wall was uncovered by the excavation in a number of places. The clearest stretch is along the west side of the North Hill, where it forms the back walls of the houses along the brow of the hill (cf. &lt;bibl n=&quot;Plat. Laws 779b&quot;&gt;Plat. Laws 779b&lt;/bibl&gt;). The line of the wall along the east side of the hill, however, is not as easy to determine. Possible traces of a fortification wall were discovered on the brow of the East Spur Hill, and the arrangement of houses and buildings in that area, suggest that the east brow of the hill formed the original limit of the city, with the wall ringed inside by a row of houses analogous to that in Rows A. This section of fortification wall probably belongs with the layout of the North Hill in 432 BC.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A section of fortification wall was uncovered at the north end of the South Hill; but whether this wall is part of the enclosure that also ringed the North Hill or part of an earlier circuit that protected only the South Hill before the anoikismos is uncertain. The South Hill must have been fortified in both periods, however: Artabazus' siege of Olynthus in 479 BC shows that it was fortified at least that early (&lt;bibl n=&quot;Hdt. 8.128&quot;&gt;Hdt. 8.128&lt;/bibl&gt;).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The South Hill has an area of some 7 hectares. The North and East Spur Hills together measure some 17 ha., including the valley between the two hills. The extent of the Villa Section was not determined: roughly 16 ha. can be documented, but the section may continue considerably farther. The area documented by the excavations therefore totals about 40 ha., with the Villa Section a wild card. By contrast, the built-up area of the city of Priene, for instance, encompasses only some 15 ha., although the walls enclose about 37 ha. Of this area, about 4 ha. was actually excavated. This is a fairly small proportion of the whole town, but is more than almost any other Greek urban site.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The North Hill was laid out in an orthogonal plan which, with some irregularities, filled the entire area of the hill. Houses were mostly grouped in blocks of ten, comprised of two rows of five houses separated by a narrow alley. On the east side of the city, however, the blocks were shortened to allow the roads to follow the topography of the hill. The streets are oriented almost due north-south and east-west.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The north-south arteries were labelled &quot;avenues&quot; A, B, C etc. by the excavators, the east-west arteries &quot;streets&quot; i, ii, iii etc. Blocks were identified by the intersection of street and avenue at their southwest corner. Within the blocks, houses are numbered from the northwest: house A v 1 is at the northwest corner of block A v; A v 2 is at the southwest corner of A v; A v 3 is the second house from the west on the north half of A v, and so forth.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Towards the eastern part of the city the grid plan becomes more irregular. The plan of the Villa Section was not completely established; all the houses in the blocks were probably not built, but space was left open around some of the houses. The grid here on the plain is oriented 2-3 degrees nearer to magnetic north than the grid on the North Hill, and is probably a later extension.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Most of the houses of Olynthus conform to a basically similar ground plan, commonly referred to as a &quot;pastas house.&quot; They are roughly square, averaging about 17.2 m. across. Two important axes cross the house from east to west: one near the midpoint of the house divides it into two nearly equal parts, the second divides the northern half into two portions. These axes govern the placement of walls and pillars, which had to be aligned to support the common roof which ran over the northern half of the entire row of houses.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Like most Greek houses, they are based around a central courtyard, often paved. The court was nearly always located on the southern half of the house (cf. &lt;bibl n=&quot;Xen. Mem. 3.8.9-10&quot;&gt;Xen. Mem. 3.8.9-10&lt;/bibl&gt;; &lt;bibl n=&quot;Aesch. PB 450-453&quot;&gt;Aesch. PB 450-453&lt;/bibl&gt;). Opening onto the north side of the court is a long portico, identified by Graham as the &quot;pastas&quot; mentioned in ancient sources. These two areas, the court and pastas, are the main unifying elements of the house, and also seem to be the foci for most of the household activities: well-lit and airy but sheltered from the sun and rain, the pastas in particular offers a convenient and comfortable work area.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Most of the other rooms open directly onto either the court or the pastas. The organization of rooms in typical Olynthian houses is thus paratactic or non-hierarchical: that is, there are relatively few &quot;back rooms&quot; on the ground floor to which access is restricted by an intermediate room. Nor is there a single dominant room or axis, as there is in the &quot;prostas&quot; type of house, as well as in the typical Roman house.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A number of different room types are commonly found in Olynthian houses. A &quot;kitchen complex&quot; consisting of a large chamber, sometimes with a built hearth, and one or two smaller spaces partly divided from it on one side, is one such unit. One of the smaller rooms usually served as a bathroom, with bathtubs frequently found in situ. The other small room seems to have been used for cooking; in most cases these rooms could be entered from the court or pastas, and they often contained ashes and many artifacts.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Another distinctive suite of rooms is the andron-anteroom complex. Androns, or formal dining rooms, are well attested both in literary sources and archaeologically, not only at Olynthus but at many other sites (e.g. &lt;bibl n=&quot;Xen. Sym. 1.13&quot;&gt;Xen. Sym. 1.13&lt;/bibl&gt;; &lt;bibl n=&quot;Aristoph. Eccl. 675ff&quot;&gt;Aristoph. Eccl. 675ff&lt;/bibl&gt;; &lt;bibl&gt;Murray 1990&lt;/bibl&gt;; &lt;bibl&gt;Hoepfner &amp; Schwandner 1986&lt;/bibl&gt;). At Olynthus, the androns are usually square, most often about 4.8 x 4.8 m., with a cement floor (occasionally decorated with mosaic) and plastered and painted walls. They are normally the most elaborately decorated of the rooms of the house. A raised border about 0.85-1.0 m. wide runs around the sides of the room. Dining couches or klinai were set on this border around the walls of the room; most androns probably held seven couches. Because of the arrangement of couches, the doors of most androns were off-center. The floor was frequently drained by a channel or pipe let through one of the walls, either into the street or occasionally into a catchbasin in the anteroom; this would facilitate washing down the floor after the boisterous and messy revelry that went on in these rooms.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A number of houses have special workrooms and shops, opening onto the street (e.g. &lt;rs type=&quot;building&quot;&gt;A iv 9&lt;/rs&gt;, &lt;rs type=&quot;building&quot;&gt;A vii 4&lt;/rs&gt;).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Within this very regular plan, however, there is considerable variation, and the apparent uniformity of the house plans is, on closer inspection, somewhat deceptive. Some houses devote a lot of space to androns, kitchens and other specialized rooms; others have more general-purpose spaces; others have many shops, and so forth. Moreover, the houses on one block tend to be more similar to one another than they are to houses on other blocks. Houses with many shops are mostly found along Avenue B, which probably formed a major commercial artery through the city. The houses of block A vi have more androns, more kitchens, and more decorated rooms than those of A v, while the north half of block A vii is much more irregularly planned than the south half. The coherence of house blocks may result from social ties among the households who built the block. The blocks thus form social as well as physical building units of the city. And the differing uses of space, equipment, and assemblages in houses in different parts of the city shows that the city was organized in different sorts of neighborhoods, and that households of different neighborhoods engaged in different trades and economies.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;On the South Hill, two public areas were excavated. At the north tip of the hill was a rather poorly-preserved area with two &quot;arsenals&quot; or stoas and fragments of other large buildings. To the south of this area is the &quot;Civic Center,&quot; consisting of a large building built of ashlars which may have been a bouleuterion or other meeting place.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Another public area is located towards the south end of the North Hill. This consists of an open plaza, about 85 m. wide and perhaps 130 m. long, which was apparently free of building. Three public buildings surround the north side and northeast corner of this plaza: a poorly preserved stoa-like building along the north side, a building with central colonnade at A iv 10 (so-called &quot;bouleuterion&quot;), and a fountain house at A iii 9. This open space was probably the agora of the city.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The fountain house in the northeast corner of the agora (building A iii 9) was fed by a large terracotta pressure pipe set some six meters below the surface at the bottom of a subterranean tunnel. The pipe continued northward beneath Avenue A, leaving the city through the gate at the northern end of the avenue. The pipe was apparently fed from sources in the hills to the north, some 12 km. away.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;No sanctuaries have been found in the city; the main sanctuary of the city may have been outside the city walls.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Three cemeteries were partly explored by Robinson's team. Some 560 graves were excavated at the main one, known as the Riverside Cemetery, which was located just to the west of the city. To the north, the North Cemetery produced only some 30 graves, more widely scattered than at the Riverside Cemetery. The third burial ground was the East Cemetery, located on a small knoll some 700 m. east of the tip of the South Hill. In addition, a Macedonian-type chamber tomb was excavated some 2 km west of the city. Robinson believed that these three graveyards were the only ones used by the Olynthians.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Thucydides asserts that Selinus was founded in 628/7 BC, one hundred years after the foundation of her metropolis, Megara Hyblaea in western Sicily (&lt;bibl n=&quot;Thuc. 6.4.2&quot;&gt;Thuc. 6.4.2&lt;/bibl&gt;). Pammilos of Megara (Nisaia) in Central Greece led the expedition as oikist (founder), for the Hyblaeans had requested an oikist be sent from their own metropolis. They were following a customary ritual which underlined the continuity of the colony with the original community, even at one remove (cf. the case of Epidamnos, &lt;bibl n=&quot;Thuc. 1.24.2&quot;&gt;Thuc. 1.24.2&lt;/bibl&gt;). Against Thucydides' conveniently round figure of 100 years after the foundation of Megara Hyblaea, the later authors Diodorus and Eusebius give a discordant foundation date of 651/0 BC (&lt;bibl n=&quot;Diod. Sic. 13.59.4&quot;&gt;Diod. Sic. 13.59.4&lt;/bibl&gt;). Their date may be borne out by archaeological finds, but here one is always in danger of relying upon circular evidence.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As a rule, a defensible island, promontory or escarpment was the most common site for a new colony, but Selinus had only a fairly low fortified hill (although in antiquity the acropolis was probably more like a peninsula since the harbors on either side extended much further inland than they do today). Pammilos could have chosen a more defensible site with better harbors and with equally fertile land to the east, so it is a puzzle why this site was chosen Similar questions are asked of the site of Himera on the north coast of Sicily, which was founded three years after Selinus according to Diodorus (&lt;bibl n=&quot;Diod. Sic. 13.62.56&quot;&gt;Diod. Sic. 13.62.56&lt;/bibl&gt;; cf. &lt;bibl n=&quot;Diod. Sic. 13.54.1&quot;&gt;Diod. Sic. 13.54.1&lt;/bibl&gt;). Both western Sicilian cities may have been convenient stops on the coasting route to and from Spain and north Africa, and Himera to Etruria as well. Both could have been settled to facilitate trade with Phoenician colonies (Selinus with Motya, Himera with Panormus [modern Palermo] and Soloeis), or to block eastward Punic expansion. In any case Greek colonial expedition were unwelcome further west. The Phoenicians and the native Elymi of northeast Sicily repulsed Dorian colonists from Lilybaion, a peninsula overlooking Motya (ca. 570 BC), and from Mt. Eryx, betwen Motya and Panormus (ca. 510 BC). The former had some bearing on Selinus, for the would-be colonists briefly joined the Elymi of Segesta against her (&lt;bibl n=&quot;Diod. Sic. 5.9&quot;&gt;Diod. Sic. 5.9&lt;/bibl&gt;) and the latter had some bearing on Minoa, a Selinuntine colony at the mouth of the Halycus River (modern Platani), for the survivors of the attempted colony of Herakleia at Mt. Eryx captured and refounded it as Herakleia Minoa (&lt;bibl n=&quot;Hdt. 5.43-46&quot;&gt;Hdt. 5.43-46&lt;/bibl&gt;).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, there is evidence of mostly amicable relations between the colonists of Himera and Selinus and the Punic colonists to their west. A metrical epitaph for a fallen Greek (Selinuntine?) dated to the first half of the fifth century has been unearthed in Motya, which had a sizable Greek element (&lt;bibl n=&quot;Diod. Sic. 46.53.2&quot;&gt;Diod. Sic. 46.53.2&lt;/bibl&gt;). Further, Hamilcar of Carthage, called in by the tyrants of Himera and Rhegion, counted upon the aid of Selinus against Theron of Akragas and Gelon of Syracuse in the Battle of Himera (480 BC).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Selinus could also have been founded to open commercial contacts with the native Elymi in the northeast corner of the island (at sites such as Segesta). In support of this, Early Corinthian pottery has been found at the Elymian town of Segesta and at a Selinuntine sanctuary to Herakles up the Hypsas river near Poggioreale (close to Elymian Entella), and the pottery can be dated as early as any found at Himera or Selinus. Fostering good relations with the neighboring peoples, Sicans, Elymi, and Phoenicians, would have allowed the Selinuntines to become prosperous through agriculture and commerce while occupying a not particularly strong site, similar to the position of their metropolis (Megara and Hyblon, &lt;bibl n=&quot;Hdt. 6.4.1&quot;&gt;Hdt. 6.4.1&lt;/bibl&gt;).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Pammilos as oikist would have overseen the division of the land into kleroi (allotments) of relatively equal size or value for each colonist. He would also have set aside land for the gods in sacred precincts, where monumental stone temples would later be built. Cult practice in these precincts probably reflects the continuity of institutions from the original mother city to later colonies. Demeter and her daughter Persephone (possibly worshipped in Selinus as Pasikrateia, &quot;all-powerful&quot;, &lt;bibl&gt;Meiggs &amp; Lewis, no. 38&lt;/bibl&gt;) held particular prominence in agriculturally rich Sicily, the site of Persephone's abduction. Demeter's cult title of Malophoros is attested only here and at Megara (Nisaia) (&lt;bibl n=&quot;Paus. 1.44.3&quot;&gt;Paus. 1.44.3&lt;/bibl&gt;), and is confirmed by inscriptions and several thousand terracotta statuettes of the goddess carrying a pomegranate. Hers was one of the first sanctuaries established (quadrangular, 50 x 60 m.) and here some of the earliest finds of pottery at Selinus have been unearthed. The main structure within the precinct is her megaron with an altar in front.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Also within the precinct wall was a shrine to her consort, Zeus Meilichios, whom farmers would invoke with chthonic Demeter at the time of sowing. Subterranean Zeus was dreadful and beneficent &mdash; he offered purification after blood-feud and ensured the growth fo crops. His epithet (&quot;Gentle One&quot;) may be a euphemism in the way that the treacherous Black Sea was called the Euxine (&quot;Kind to Travelers&quot;), or it may indicate his role in appeasing the dead. Inscribed stelai, sometimes with two heads sculpted at the top, were dedicated to Meilichios &mdash; perhaps remnants of primal aniconic stone-worship (cf. &lt;bibl&gt;Jeffery 1990, 255, 270-1, 277:31-2&lt;/bibl&gt;), or perhaps the result of Punic influence. His cult seems to have been under the care of an aristocratic Selinuntine genos, the kleulidai, in the same way that in Megara his cult was under the care of an (unrelated) genos. There was also a temple of Hekate (cf. &lt;bibl&gt;Jeffery 1990, 271, 277.41&lt;/bibl&gt;) and an elaborate propylon to the whole complex. The precinct seems to have served both Greeks (from the mainland as well as colonists) and natives. The propylon was partially remodelled during the Punic/Hellenistic period, and the megaron of Demeter was modified in the Byzantine period.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The colossal Temple X, on the acropolis south of Temple C, and the smaller Temple Y (from which some decoration survives &mdash; metopes and cornice decoration) were leveled to their foundations by the sixth century, when Selinus undertook an impressive series of temple-building projects, the first of which was Temple C (mid-sixth century; see &lt;rs type=&quot;building&quot;&gt;Selinus,Temple C&lt;/rs&gt;). It was built upon the highest point of the acropolis, and now lies in ruins. This is one of the earliest examples of Archaic temple building in the Doric style: hexastyle (six columns on the fronts), constructed on a notably elongated plan, with a narrow cella and with large, tapered columns (some monolithic, some drums). Carved metopes from the Doric frieze survive, as well as two painted terracotta gorgoneia from each pediment (a Western Greek phenomenon, with other examples found at Syracuse, Gela and one in stone at Corcyra). The limestone of the friezes and columns was covered with plaster and painted as well. The first altar of the temple lies to the southeast and the later altar is to the east.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Not much later are Temple D on the acropolis and Temple F (S) on the eastern plateau (both second half of the 6th century BC). Both are about the same width as temple C; both are hexastyle, and both have narrow cellas, but they are not as elongated as Temple C. The sculptured metopes of Temple F have survived. This temple also has enigmatic intercolumnar screen walls.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The massive Temple G (T), dedicated to Apollo, was begun not much later on the eastern plateau, the first colossal temple in the West to vie with the great Ionic temples of Asia Minor. It measures some 50.1 x 110.36 m. Like the Ionic temples, it is octastyle (8 columns on the fronts). The work was begun on the east side in the late 6th century, and moved slowly west, until finally the west side was nearing completion in the fifth century BC; different parts of the temple thus show markedly different styles. The interior was so vast that it was probably never intended to be roofed. The ambitious project was abandoned some time before (or because of) the Carthaginian attack of 409 BC, and column drums of matching proportions have been left half-carved in the quarries 9 km to the northwest at Cusa/Campobello.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While work on Temple G was in progress, the Selinuntines began Temples A and O on the acropolis and Temple E (R) on the eastern plateau (ca. 480 BC, after the defeat of Hamilcar at Himera). The temples exhibit a more developed Doric style, with the spacing between columns contracting as they reached the corners. The sculptured metopes of Temple E were made of limestone covered with plaster, but with marble inserts for heads, hands and feet of female figures (&quot;acrolithic&quot; sculpture). The ruins of Temple F have been restored, while Temples A and O were joined together in the medieval period and rebuilt as a fortified tower.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Pammilos would have erected at least a wooden palisade on the acropolis, and this was replaced by stone fortifications, much of which survives. Most of the remains of the extensive circuit wall can be dated to the late 6th/early 5th c. BC, with evidence of repairs made by Hermocrates ca. 408 BC. The fortifications and gate complex at the northern end of the acropolis, leading out to the Manuzza hill and residential quarter, are particularly impressive.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <physical>&lt;P&gt;The city was the westernmost colony in Sicily. The acropolis occupies a low hill along the southern coast of the island, with harbors on either side &mdash; the western one formed by the mouth of the river Selinus (modern Modione) and the eastern one by the river Calici (modern Cotone). Neither river is much more than a marsh today. The city extended northwards onto the hill now known as the Manuzza, and to the east onto ridge occupied by three great Doric temples, and was surrounded by fertile agricultural land.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A native Sican settlement had occupied the site of the later Archaic cemetery to the NE, and coexisted with the Greek settlement in its early years. Corinthian pottery of the mid-seventh century as been found on the necropolis (which lay on either side of the river Selinus, extending up to 5 km. from the town) and at the sanctuaries, and there are some traces of temple building in the seventh century as well (Temples X and Y on the acropolis).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A Greek grid-planned town on the Manuzza hill to the north of the acropolis is conspicuous in aerial photographs, and has recently been partly excavated.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A major sanctuary dedicated to the Chthonic deities Demeter, Zeus and Hekate was situated on the west bank of the river Selinus (the Sanctuary of Demeter Malophoros). On the acropolis were four large Doric temples, two of the sixth century, two of the fifth, and a small shrine. None of these has been securely attributed to specific deities, but are identified by letters (Temples A, C, D, and O; Shrine B). Defensive walls girded the acropolis, most of whose standing remains can be dated to the late sixth or early fifth centuries B.C. To the north of the city lay a small Archaic temple and altar.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;On the plateau to the east of the city, across the Calici river, were three more sixth-century Doric temples, Temples E, F, and G (also known as R, S and T respectively). The material remains are impressive, particularly the stone metopes and terracotta gorgoneia from Temple C (now in the Palermo Museum) and the massive, unfinished Temple G, attributed to Apollo and one of the largest Greek temples ever attempted.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The city was destroyed by Carthaginians in 409 BC (&lt;bibl n=&quot;Diod. Sic. 13.54-62&quot;&gt;Diod. Sic. 13.54-62&lt;/bibl&gt;). Though the area of the acropolis was resettled by survivors and by the Carthaginians, Selinus never regained prominence. The city remained under Punic control until 250 B.C. when, after Carthage had again razed the city, the site was essentially deserted. The acropolis was refortified in the Byzantine period, and the sanctuary of the Chthonic divinities was also reused then.&lt;/P&gt; </physical>
