<p><CENTER><h2>CHAPTER 5:  SEARCH TOOLS</h2></CENTER><HR><br><br>
With the large scope of data in Perseus, specialized tools are needed to give
you control of the data and access to it. The searching tools described in this
chapter help you find information quickly and make your search methods
strategic and efficient. With the searching tools you can:<br>
-find specific objects (a particular vase, a text reference, an image).<br>

-find classes of objects (plays by Sophocles, vases by Euphronios, sculpture of
the Archaic period, coins keyworded with "Scylla").<br>

-see textual and visual summaries of objects before going to the more detailed
sources of information.<br>

-store search requests until the appropriate cd-rom is online.<br>
<p>
The basic tools for searching across the Perseus database are the Browser,
Thumbnail Browser, English Index and Search Saver. The Browser and Thumbnail
Browser, in particular, help you target information for detailed study and
spend less time following false leads. A fifth tool, the CD Swapper, is used to
store requests for information that is on another cd-rom. <br>
The Lookup tool, explained in the previous chapter, performs some limited
searching features, but it is primarily a navigation tool for going directly to
resources in Perseus.

<h3><a name="5.1">5.1 BROWSER</a></h3>
The Browser offers a centralized way of finding and viewing data in Perseus. It
provides a way to search through vases, sculpture, coins, sites, architecture,
and texts looking for various attributes and keywords. You can choose the
Browser from the Gateway or the Links menu (figure 5.1).<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/5.1.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 5.1 Browser. In this pop-up menu, the user chooses
<tt>Collection</tt> to display search results by Collection.</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>&gt;	Search for vases in Perseus from the Early Classical period.<p>
From the Gateway, click the Browser icon, or from anywhere in Perseus, choose
<tt>Browser</tt> from the Links menu. <p>
Click the <tt>Vases</tt> button upper left to highlight it (
<IMG src="/img/help/5.1a.gif">).
Immediately to the right of the Vases button is a pop-up menu containing search
topics. Choose <tt>Period</tt> from this pop-up menu. A list of attributes
appears in the field below. In this case, it is a list of chronological
periods.<p>
Many objects in the Perseus database have been linked to the Browser by
keyword, an item in the search topic pop-up menu. If you choose the item
Keywords, a second pop-up menu appears for you to select a category of
keywords. The Keyword search feature does not work for texts, however. The
Browser searches texts  by Author, Title, Genre, Form, Period and Region. You
can use the English Index, described below <A HREF="#5.3">5.3</A>, to search texts for the
appearance of any English word.<p>
Scroll down and click the line <tt>Early Classical</tt> in the list of
attributes. Your selection is indicated by the boldface type. As soon as you
click a line in the attribute list, the Browser conducts the search. The
Browser puts the results into three columns.<p>
The parameters of your search are recorded in the horizontal field below the
list of object types and the attribute list (Figure 5.2). This information
indicates the object database, search topic, the number of objects identified
with those parameters, and the number of pages of results listed in the three
columns.<p>
<b>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/5.2.gif"></b><p>
<b>Figure 5.2 Search parameters.</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>In the example used here, the search for vases of the Early Classical
period yields 178 vases. The page indicator shows page 1 of 4. A "page" in this
context means a list of 50 or fewer objects. If a search yields more than 50
objects, the Browser shows the first 50 objects on page 1 of the results and
the remainder on page 2 (or more). To change the page of results currently
shown, choose a new page from the <tt>Page</tt> pop-up menu. Note that when you
hold the mouse down on this pop-up menu, the information that appears in the
pop-up includes a brief description of the search and the corresponding page
number. <p>
Use the scroll bar on the far right to scroll through the three-column list.
The three columns may be viewed by any attribute. Change the attribute viewed
in any column by using the pop-up menu at the top of the column. Change the
width of a column by holding the cursor at the top of the vertical dividing
line and dragging to change the column width; note that the cursor changes from
Pointer to Field-expander mode (figure 5.3).<p>
The labels at the top of each column are pop-up menus listing all possible
attributes of that type of object. You can display any attribute in any column.
By default, the object's name always appears in the left column. In this
example, the first vase listed is from the Archer M. Huntington Art Gallery,
University of Texas at Austin, identified as such by the attribute Collection.
Its catalog Name is Austin 1980.63, and its Shape is Lekythos (Figure 5.3). <p>
If attributes other than Name, Collection and Shape appear at the top of the
three columns, they have been reset by a previous user.<p>
Change the type of information shown in the middle column by choosing
<tt>Summary</tt> from the pop-up menu at the top of the middle column. Now you
can read that this vase shows  "Flying Nike with kithara and phiale."<p>
If there is not sufficient room in the field to read its contents, hold the
mouse on the border between the two fields. It will change to Field-expander
mode. Drag to the right or left to expand or contract the field (figure 5.3).<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/5.3.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 5.3 Pop-up menus with cursor in Field-expander mode.</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>&gt;	Click any line item in the left column to go to its Catalog card.
<p>
The images and descriptions are stored on the Catalog cards. Return to the
Browser by clicking the Go Back arrow on the Navigator Palette. <p>
Note that you must always link to an object by clicking on a line in the left
column; the left will remain active, regardless of its attribute setting.<p>
&gt;	To save the results of your search, click the Search Saver icon on the
Navigator Palette.<p>
A description of the Search Saver is given in <A HREF="ch4.html#4.3">chapter 4.3</A>.<p>
The Browser sorts object databases only within the attribute appearing by
default at the left. The default settings for the six object databases are,
left to right: <p>
Vases - Name, Collection and Shape.<br>
Sculpture - Collection, Title and Type <br>
Coins - Name, Collection and Material <pbr>
Sites - Name, Type and Summary<br>
Architecture - Name, Type and Site<br>
<p>
&gt;	Click the <tt>Thumbs</tt> button (upper right) to open the Thumbnail
Browser.<p>
The Thumbnail Browser feature is described separately in <A HREF="#5.2">section 5.2</A> below.

<a name="5.2">5.2
THUMBNAIL BROWSER
</a></h3>
The Thumbnail Browser is a new browsing tool in Perseus 2.0 used to survey and
select images. It gives you a quick and comprehensive visual overview of a
single object or group of objects. The Thumbnail Browser displays a series of
postage-stamp size images ("thumbnails") in a single full color window (figure
5.4). You can page and browse through hundreds of thumbnails without having to
call up the full-size images. <p>
The Thumbnail Browser displays images from three databases: vases, sculpture,
and coins. It also comes in two sizes, small and large, to accommodate
different memory conditions. The Thumbnail Browser is an image-based tool and
requires large amounts of free memory - a setting of at least 5 MB of
application memory is recommended. The small Thumbnail Browser shows a
two-by-two array of thumbnail images, or a total of four per page. The large
Thumbnail Browser shows a two-by-three array of thumbnail images, or a total of
six per page. <p>
Perseus is set to use the small Thumbnail Browser by default. You may change
the default by going to the Thumbnail Browser Settings card, described below.<p>
The Thumbnail Browser is most useful when you want to survey a large group of
images without having to call up each full-size image. The Thumbnail Browser is
not as useful for surveying only a few images.<p>
Once you have stored visual data in the Thumbnail Browser, you can leave it
open and return to it as you continue your work. If you no longer need the
Thumbnail Browser, close it to free up memory.<p>
Note that all three Thumbnail Browser windows (Vases, Sculpture, Coins) can be
left open simultaneously. You may want to close one or more windows to free up
memory.<p>
The Thumbnail Browser is opened from the Browser and the Catalog summary cards
by clicking on the <tt>Thumbs</tt> button. The following example continues
search for all vases of the Early Classical period described in the section
above.)<p>
&gt;	Click the <tt>Thumbs</tt> button on the Browser after the search results
have appeared.<p>
The Thumbnail Browser for vases will appear (figure 5.4). (Depending on the
speed of your system, this may take a moment.) The thumbnail images that appear
represent one to three canonical images of each vase found in the search.
Please be aware that the Thumbnail Browser displays images for only one page of
Browser results at a time. You must return to the Browser and choose a new page
of results before you can obtain Thumbnail images for the new page.<p>
                          
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/5.4.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 5.4 Thumbnail Browser, small, showing page 18 of 22 of Early
Classical vases.</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>Note that when the Thumbnail Browser is accessed <i>from the
Browser</i>, it does not show all possible images for each vase, but rather the
canonical images, usually two. When you use the Thumbnail Browser from the
<i>Catalog summary cards</i>, all possible images for the object are shown as
thumbnails.<p>
A black box around an image indicates that this image is selected and that its
caption appears in the caption field.<p>
&gt;	Click other images on this page of the Thumbnail Browser to select
different images and see their captions.<p>
The caption shows the image number, videodisc frame (if applicable), Perseus
object reference, caption and credits. The last line of the caption is a
descriptive line about the image.<p>
NOTE: Do not double-click the thumbnail images. To see the full-size image of a
thumbnail, select it by clicking it once, then clicking  the button
<tt>Picture</tt>, upper right. (If you double-click a thumbnail image, it will
change to a different image not necessarily related to the images currently
selected.)<p>
&gt;	The Thumbnail Browser indicates how many pages of thumbnail images are
available and the current page number. <p>
Choose a different page from the <tt>Page</tt> pop-up menu.<p>
&gt;	Click <tt>Picture</tt> to view the full-size image of the thumbnail
currently selected (i.e., the one surrounded by a black box).<p>
&gt;	Click <tt>Catalog</tt> to open the catalog summary of the object depicted
by the current thumbnail. (Hold the shift key down to open the catalog in a new
window.)<p>
&gt;	Change the default from small to large Thumbnail Browser.<p>
From the Gateway, select the Settings icon. The Perseus Settings card appears.
Go to the next card, Thumbnail Browser Settings, by clicking once on the Go
Forward (right) arrow on the Navigator Palette.<p>
Unlock the card by selecting <tt>Edit Settings</tt>. A dialog window appears
asking if you are sure you want to make the change. If so, click <tt>Yes</tt>.
If you are not sure that your computer has adequate memory for the large
Thumbnail Browser, click the <tt>Advise</tt> button. Click the button <tt>Large
Thumbnails.</tt> Please be sure to click the <tt>Lock Settings</tt> button
before leaving the card.<p>
&gt;	Change the movie locations. (For network administrators.)<p>
From the Gateway, select the Settings icon. The Perseus Settings card appears.
Go to the next card, Thumbnail Browser Settings, by clicking once on the Go
Forward (right) arrow on the Navigator Palette.<p>
Unlock the card by clicking on the button <tt>Edit Settings</tt>. A dialog
window appears asking if you are sure you want to make the change. If so, click
<tt>Yes</tt>. <p>

ENGLISH INDEX 
</a></h3>
With the English Index tool, you can perform word searches in English
throughout the entire range of Perseus databases and link with the results of
your search. The English Index is located under the Links menu.<p>
The English Index (figure 5.5) is an index of all English words in Perseus
occurring in the translation of all the primary texts or the works of a
selected author and in the Atlas, Encyclopedia, Historical Overview, and
catalogs of archaeological objects. You can use this tool to search for
locations of an English word or a string of letters at the beginning, middle or
ending of a word.<p>
<b>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/5.5.gif"></b><p>
<b>Figure 5.5 English Index. Note that the search has been made for the string
"weav" occurring anywhere in the word, and that the list of results has been
made to start at  Euripides .</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>&gt;	Look for the string "weav" occurring anywhere in a word in all of
Perseus.<p>
The string "weav" was chosen because the search will produce results not only
for "weave," but for "unweave," "weaving-pins," etc.<p>
Choose <tt>English Index</tt> from the Links menu. Click the "Look for" field
to make the insertion point appear. Type in <tt>weav</tt>.<p>
Choose <tt>Top of List</tt> from the <tt>Show List at</tt> pop-up menu. <p>
You can narrow your search by choosing a designated search area (for example,
All Text for all Primary Text works, a selected author, the Atlas, or the
Encyclopedia).<p>
Choose the type of search from the <tt>Position</tt> pop-up menu (<tt>Exact
Match</tt> for a complete word, <tt>Anywhere</tt> for a string of characters
anywhere within a word, <tt>Starting Characters</tt> or <tt>Ending
Characters</tt>). In this case, choose <tt>Anywhere</tt>.<p>
Click <tt>Do Search</tt> to activate the word search. The results of the search
will be reported on the left. Select any word to bring up its citation<p>
You can save the list of citations by clicking on the Search Saver icon on the
Navigator Palette. Use of the Search Saver is described more thoroughly
below.<p>
&gt;	Go immediately to a citation.<p>
Scroll down  and highlight the citation you wish to link with.<p>
Click the <tt>Go There</tt> button to go directly to a reference within
Perseus.<p>
Note that there are two Macintosh techniques involved in operating the English
Index. First, you can select a word from the list by clicking it. Second, to go
to a citation, you must hightlight it, and then click <tt>Go There</tt>.<p>
To return from a reference to the English Index, click the Go Back arrow on the
Navigator Palette.

<a name="5.4">5.4
SEARCH SAVER
</a></h3>
The Search Saver is a tool designed to store your search results obtained
during a Perseus session. This tool is accessed from the Search Saver  icon on
the Navigator Palette, and lives in a floating window. It stores a list of
object citations found in a search that may be linked with the objects inside
Perseus to which they refer. Each citation can be clicked to go to the full
entry. For example, when you use the Browser to search for Early Classical
vases, you can use the Search Saver to avoid returning to the Browser each time
you want to link with a new vase summary on its Catalog card.<p>
The contents of the Search Saver are automatically erased when you save a new
search, when you close the Search Saver by clicking in the box in the upper
left, and when you end your Perseus session. The procedure for permanently
saving your searches is explained below.
<h4>
<a name="5.4.1">5.4.1
SAVING SEARCHES FROM THE BROWSER
</a></h4>
As you use Perseus to investigate a topic, you can temporarily store the
results of searches produced by the data base tools, such as the Browser and
Philological Tools, in the Search Saver. Your results are kept in a floating
window that remains open until you close it (figure 5.6). Once you have stored
a search in the Search Saver window, you can continue working in the same tool
or resource, or go to a new part of Perseus while the results of the stored
search remain accessible.<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/5.6.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 5.6 Search Saver appearing as a floating window over the Browser.
Note that only the results from the left column of the Browser are saved.</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>The following example continues the search for all vases of the Early
Classical period described in <A HREF="#5.1">section 5.1</A> above).<p>
To save the results of a search, click the Search Saver icon on the Navigator
Palette.<p>
The Search Saver window appears, with the results of the current search copied
into it, in this case, the contents of the far left column of the Browser. If
you change the attribute displayed in the left column of the Browser and click
the Search Saver icon again, the Search Saver will list the search results
using the new attribute. <p>
By default, vases are listed by name, collection, and shape. If you would like
to save a more descriptive list of Early Classical vases, you can change the
attribute of the left column to Summary by releasing the mouse on that item
under the pop-up menu (figure 5.7), then click the Search Saver icon. The
Search Saver lists the vases found in your search by summary, the attribute
selected for display in the left column.<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/5.7.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 5.7. Browser with Summary in left column of results.</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>Try to store searches in the Search Saver with descriptive or varying
information, such as catalog number, name, or summary. This will create a more
useful list than a list with 28 entries for "kylix."<p>
Now click the Search Saver icon to save the results by Summary.<p>
&gt;	Select a line in the Search Saver window.<p>
To continue the example of vases of the Early Classical period, click the top
line in the Search Saver window ("Side A: Woman and young warrior pouring
libation...", if results are listed by Summary (Figure 5.8), or Ann Arbor
77.7.1, if results are listed by Name). Perseus will display the Catalog card
containing the summary of this vase. When you want to see another vase from the
search, click another line in the Search Saver window. <p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/5.8.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 5.8. Click a line in the Search Saver to link with its Perseus
Catalog card.</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>The Search Saver window retains the current search results as long as
the Search Saver window is open. Clicking the Search Saver icon to save a new
search will replace the current search results. Clicking the close box of the
Search Saver window will close the Search Saver and will erase the current
search results.<p>
If the results of your search are more than one page, the Search Saver will
store only the current page. Thus, to save an entire search of more than one
page, you will need to use the Search Saver to Notebook feature, described
below.
<h4>
<a name="5.4.2">5.4.2
SAVING SEARCHES FROM OTHER PERSEUS DATABASES
</a></h4>
The Search Saver can be used to store a search from any list of data references
inside Perseus. These areas include the English Index, Philological Tools,
Indexes, and Catalog card image lists.<p>
With the English Index, the Search Saver always stores the Perseus canonical
references. Canonical references can be typed or copied into the Lookup tool in
the Links menu to go directly to a reference.<p>
When you use the Philological Tools to conduct searches, you can also use the
Search Saver to store the results. In this case, the Search Saver stores the
results applicable to the particular tool (citations for Greek Words in
Proximity, words and their locations for the Greek Word Search, and so on).<p>
&gt;	Save the results of a Greek Word Search for &eacute;lk&AElig; in
Euripides.<p>
Choose <tt>Greek Word Search</tt> from the Links menu. Type &eacute;lk&AElig;
(courage) into the <tt>Look for</tt> field if GreekKeys is installed in your
system. <p>
Or, if you do not have SMK GreekKeys installed, you will need to copy and paste
the word in. Go to Euripides Phoenissae 274 (by typing Eur. Phoen. 274 into the
Lookup tool and pressing Return), copy &eacute;lk&AElig; from the text and
paste it into the <tt>Look for</tt> field in Greek Word Search. Further
information on GreekKeys and typing in Greek characters is given in sections
<A HREF="ch2.html#2.1.2">2.1.2</A> and <A HREF="ch8b.html#8.4.1">8.4.1</A>.<p>
Choose <tt>Euripides</tt> from the pop-up menu on the right. Click the <tt>Do
Search</tt> button.<p>
The results appearing in the lower left are nine forms derived from
&eacute;lk&AElig;. Choose <tt>Citations for All Forms</tt> from the
<tt>Options</tt> pop-up menu.<p>
Save theses citations by clicking the Search Saver icon on the Navigator
Palette figure 5.9). <p>
                                      
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/5.9.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 5.9 Results of Greek Word Search in Search Saver.</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>Go to a citation by selecting it in the Search Saver. <p>
The Search Saver can also be used to compare the results of one search with the
results of another search. After you have saved the results of a search in the
Search Saver, perform a second search with different parameters. One set of
results appears in the Search Saver window, and the second is in the current
tool. 
<h4>
<a name="5.4.3">5.4.3
USE THE SEARCH SAVER TO NOTEBOOK FEATURE
</a></h4>
Maintain a permanent record of your search by choosing <tt>Search Saver to
Notebook</tt> from the Perseus menu. A Notebook card will appear (figure
5.10)<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/5.10.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 5.10 Notebook card with Word Search results copied from Search
