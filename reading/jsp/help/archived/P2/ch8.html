Perseus 2.0 contains selections from the works of Aristotle, Diodorus Siculus, Strabo, and Plutarch.  The other authors are complete, but fragmentary texts are not included in this version, except in the cases of Bacchylides, the Homeric Hymns, and Hyperides.
Each Primary Text has an English translation. In many cases, the texts are
accompanied by notes. Notes from the Loeb editions are given for Aeschines,
Aeschylus, Andocides, Antiphon, Demades, Demosthenes, Dinarchus, Diodorus,
Herodotus, Hesiod, Hyperides, Isaeus, Isocrates, Lycurgus, Lysias, Pausanias,
Plato, Plutarch, Pseudo-Xenophon, and Xenophon. Although some notes are
attached to the Greek text (Plato, <i>Symposium</i>, and Sophocles, <i>Oedipus
Tyrannus</i> ), most are on the English translation. Aristophanes' <i>Clouds,
Lysistrata</i> and <i>Acharnians</i> have English translations and accompanying
notes by Jeffrey Henderson. Several plays by Euripides were translated and
annotated by David Kovacs: <i>Andromache, Cyclops, Heraclides, Hippolytus
</i>and <i>Medea. </i>The Pindar and Bacchylides translations, both by Diane
Svarlien, include her notes. Other notes are those prepared for the Loeb series
by J. G. Frazer (Apollodorus), W. H. Fyfe (Aristotle, <i>Poetics</i>), J. H.
Freese (Aristotle, <i>Rhetoric</i>), H. Tredennick (Aristotle,
<i>Metaphysics</i>),  Oldfather, Sherman and Welles (Diodorus Siculus), and H.
L. Jones (Strabo).<p>
Primary Texts are accessible from the Primary Text Index, which is reached from
the Gateway and the Links menu. Texts can also be reached from the Lookup tool
(see <A HREF="ch4.html#4.5.1">section 4.5.1</A>).

<HR><h3><a name="8.1">8.1 PRIMARY TEXTS INDEX
</a></h3>
To go to the Primary Texts Index from the Gateway, click the icon. Or from
anywhere in Perseus, choose Primary Texts from the Links Menu .<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/8.1.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 8.1 Primary Text Index alphabetically by author.</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>Choose an index from the pop-up menu <tt>Index Types.Primary Texts are
indexed</tt> in the following four ways: alphabetically by author, by form
(dactylic hexameter, drama, lyric and prose), by genre (Biography, Comedy,
etc.) and chronologically by date of the work. When alphabetical sort is
invoked, an alphabetical list of authors appears. When an author is selected, a
list of that author's works appears on the right (figure 8.1). <p>
The following illustration of Primary Text features will use the First Olympian
of Pindar.<p>
&gt;	From the Primary Text Index (alphabetically by author) scroll down and
click on Pindar. <p>
A list of that author's works appears. In figure 8.1, Pindar has been selected,
and the available works of Pindar appear in the list on the right.<p>
&gt;	To select a work, click its title. In this case, click <i>Olympian
1</i>.<p>
A text card appears, displaying the beginning of the work.
<HR><h3><a name="8.2">8.2 PRIMARY TEXTS DISPLAY 
</a></h3>
The default display of a Primary Text is two columns, Greek on the left and the
translation on the right. Figure 8.2 shows an example of a Primary Text
display.<p>
  
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/8.2.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 8.2 Primary Text display.</b><p>
</CENTER><b></b>Primary Texts have several utilities on the card and a Text menu,
described below.
<h4>
<a name="8.2.1">8.2.1 TITLE
</a></h4>
The title of the work appears at the top of each Primary Text card. In the top
right is additional title information, if appropriate. 
<h4>
<a name="8.2.2">8.2.2 TEXT REFERENCE
</a></h4>
The chapter and section or line reference in the current work is shown at the
left of the utility bar.
<h4>
<a name="8.2.3">8.2.3 METER OR STRUCTURE
</a></h4>
If the current text is in verse, metrical or strophe information is shown in
the area next to the text reference. <p>
Note that the structure of the First Olympian is given, with current strophe,
epode and antistrophe appearing in this area. Also, the entire structural unit
has been made to fit on one text card whenever practical. <p>
If the text is a forensic speech, this area may display information about its
structure. If the text is a prose work, nothing appears in this location. 
<h4>
<a name="8.2.4">8.2.4 UTILITY BAR</a></h4>
The Utility Bar has five buttons that allow you to access, analyze the text and
modify the text interface (figure 8.3).<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/8.3.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 8.3 Utility bar.</b></CENTER>
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC8">Go
to...
</a></h5>
This utility allows you to go to a specific reference in the current text. The
location is identified by chapter and section or by line, depending on the
canonical reference system for that work. The title of the current work is
shown at the top of each Primary Text display. <p>
You may use the Go To feature to move to different references within the
current work. You may also use Go To to move around in authors such as
Herodotus and Homer, whose lengthy works consist of many books on several
stacks. However, you cannot use the Go To feature to move to a location in a
different work when that work is in a different stack, nor can you use it to go
to work by a different author.  <p>
&gt;	Go to another line in the first Olympian.<p>
When you click <tt>Go To</tt>, a dialog box appears for you to type in the
chapter and section or line that you want to see (figure 8.4). Click the
<tt>Go</tt> button to see the passage you selected. (You can also press Return
if you have just typed in the reference.)<p>
   
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/8.4.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 8.4 Using the Go To feature.</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>The syntax for entering chapter, section, and line numbers varies
depending on the canonical reference system in use for that work. For example,
to use the Go To feature in Herodotus, type <tt>3.2.1</tt> to go to Book 3,
chapter 2, section 1. If you wish, simply type <tt>3</tt> (with no section or
line number) to go to the beginning of Book 3. In another example, if you are
in the text of <i>The Libation Bearers</i> by Aeschylus, type <tt>45</tt> in
the Go To box to go to line 45. <p>
Note that the Go To dialog box shows the canonical abbreviation for this author
and work that is required by the Lookup tool when you use it as a shortcut. For
more information, refer to the instructions in<A HREF="ch4.html#4.5.1"> chapter 4.5.1</A>. <p>
When you bring up the Go To dialog box, it contains your current location in
the text expressed as a canonical reference, i.e., in the correct syntax for
Perseus to look up the passage. <p>
You cannot go to the text of another author using the Go To feature. Use the
Lookup tool in the Links menu to go directly to another text reference. 
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC9">Find
Text...
</a></h5>
Find Text allows you to search for a phrase, a word, or part of a word in the
current work. You can search for Greek or English text. This search utility is
limited to the work of the author you have selected. The Browser and the
Philological Tools provide more complex search utilities.<p>
When you click <tt>Find Text</tt>, a dialog box appears for you to enter the
text that you want to find. The dialog box also has a pop-up menu to choose
whether you want to search for Greek or English text (figure 8.5). <p>
&gt;	Find other instances of words beginning with <IMG src="/img/help/chrus_.gif"> in Pindar's First
Olympian.<p>
   
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/8.5.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 8.5 Using the "Find text" feature.</b><p>
</CENTER><b></b>Highlight <IMG src="/img/help/chrus.gif"> from <IMG src="/img/help/chrusos.gif"> in line 1 of the First Olympian. Click
the button <tt>Find Text</tt>. A dialog window appears with <IMG src="/img/help/chrus.gif"> in the the
Search For box. Click <tt>Search</tt>. The next occurrence of the text string
is located and surrounded by a frame in the Primary Text display. (Strings are
discussed in <A HREF="ch8b.html#8.4.1">section 8.4.1</A> below.) Click <tt>Find Text</tt> again to repeat the
search. <p>
To type accented Greek into the Search For box, you must have GreekKeys 7.0
installed in your system. Please read "A note on typing Greek" in <A HREF="ch8b.html#8.4.1">section 8.4.1</A>
below.<p>
To search for an English word or string of letters, choose <tt>English</tt>
from the pop-up menu, lower left. Type the desired string into the Search For
box and click <tt>Search</tt>.<p>
NOTE: Usual Macintosh procedure is to double-click the mouse to select a word.
The accents do not allow this action in the Greek font, however. You must
click-drag the mouse in order to select a whole Greek word. <p>
When all occurrences of the text in this work have been found and the search
cycle begins to repeat itself, a dialog box informs you that the first piece of
text has been found again. <p>
For more powerful searches, use the Greek Word Search to look for all instances
of a Greek word in Primary Texts. Use the English Index to look for instances
of an English word. <i></i>
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC10">See
Note
</a></h5>
Almost all of the texts are accompanied by notes on the translation. See below
for notes based on the Greek text. The notes vary in their scope and length,
and are indicated by asterisks in the text.<p>
&gt;	Go to Svarlien's note on lines 8-11 of Pindar's First Olympian.<p>
Select the asterisk following the line "enfolds the wisdom of poets" in the
English text. Click the button <tt>See Note</tt>. The note appears in a new
window, which can be left open as you work on the text (figure 8.6).You can
page through the notes using the Forward and Backward arrows on the Navigator
Palette. Click <tt>See Note in Text</tt> to return to the annotated passage.
Close the Notes window by clicking the box in the upper left.<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/8.6.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 8.6 Note to English text of Pindar's First Olympian.</b><p>
</CENTER><b></b>The Notes feature does not demand a precise selection of the asterisk.
If you select a portion of the text preceding and following the asterisk, the
correct note will still appear. If the text you select is keyed to more than
one note, a list of possible notes will appear, and you can select one from the
list.<p>
Two works have notes keyed to the Greek text. Sophocles' <i>Oedipus
Tyrannus</i> has notes by Sir Richard Jebb, and Plato's <i>Symposium</i> has
extensive notes by Gilbert Rose, from the Bryn Mawr Classical Commentary (the
English text of the <i>Symposium</i> contains the Loeb notes as well). Notes in
the Greek text are not signaled by asterisks. To bring up the notes, select
some Greek text within the line (figure 8.7). Click on <tt>See Note</tt>. A
dialog window will appear. In the example in figure 8.7, there are three notes
to line 1 of the <I>OT</I>. Click the note you wish to see, then click <tt>Go
There</tt>. The note appears in a new window, and behaves just like the notes
to English text described above. Please remember to hold down the Shift key
when clicking <tt>Go There</tt> in order to keep the text window open.<p>
See below for information on how to access Greek and English notes from the
Text menu.<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/8.7.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 8.7 Notes to Greek Text.</b><p>
</CENTER><b></b>The note stacks are titled by their source (in the example shown in
figure 8.6, Pindar Svarlien Notes (E)). The title of the note is a numerical
reference that indicates the relevant section of the Primary Text or
translation and a note number. For example, Soph. Jebb (gk),<I> OT</I> 1 (1) in the
figure above indicates Sophoces, Jebb note on Greek text of <i>Oedipus
Tyrannus</i>, line 1, first of three notes on that line. <p>
Some notes have references to other ancient texts. When these works are part of
Perseus, the citation is underlined. You can select the reference and choose
Lookup from the Links menu to access it directly.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC11">Analyze</a></h5>
The Analyze button provides access to the Morphological Analysis tool, which
parses Greek words to their dictionary form. The example will continue to draw
from Pindar's First Olympian.<p>
&gt;	Analyze the form of a Greek verb.<p>
Select  <IMG src="/img/help/eld.gif"> from line 4 of the First Olympian. Click
<tt>Analyze</tt>. Perseus analyzes <IMG src="/img/help/eld.gif"> on a Morphological
Analysis card, showing the dictionary form of the word, and its parse (figure
8.8). You can then use the dictionary form of the word to conduct further
searches in selected authors and works. See below for more information on the
Philological Tools.<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/8.8.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 8.8 Analysis of <IMG src="/img/help/eld.gif"> from text of Pindar.</b><p>
</CENTER><b></b>Even if you have placed a word in the "Find text" field, you must
highlight it using standard Macintosh techniques before using Analyze.<p>
The parse "pres ind mp 2nd sg epic ionic" is explained in Online help for the
Morphological Analysis philological tool. For more information on Online help,
see <A HREF="ch3.html#3.3">chapter 3.3</A>.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC12">Primary
Text Display
</a></h5>
<IMG src="/img/help/8.8b.gif"><p>
Primary texts can be displayed as two columns (Greek on the left, English on
the right) or two rows (Greek on the top, English on the bottom). The Primary
Text display is controlled by a button at the right of the screen, below the
additional title information. The Primary Text display button shows two
outlines of the display choices. You can also change the width of the columns
or height of the rows to see more of the Greek or English text at one time. The
default Primary Text display is two equal columns.<p>
&gt;	Click the right half of the Primary Text display button to change the
format of the text to rows rather than columns. <p>
The Primary Text is now displayed in two rows.<p>
&gt;	Click the left half of the Primary Text display button to return the
format of the text to columns. <p>
Note that the vertical dividing line between the columns has a dark, wide
marker at its top. This marker can be dragged to the left or right to change
the width of the columns.<p>
&gt;	Point the cursor over the dark, wide marker at the top of the column
dividing line.<p>
When the cursor is over the marker, the cursor becomes a vertical bar with
arrows on either side (Field-expander mode).<p>
&gt;	Drag the marker to the left. Point the cursor over the marker again and
drag it to the far right.<p>
Note how the widths of the columns change according to the place where you
released the mouse button. If you switch the display to rows, change the height
of the rows by finding the marker at the left of the horizontal dividing
line.<p>
The effect of changing the display and enlarging the area containing the Greek
text is particularly effective when working with poetry (figure 8.9).<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/8.9.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 8.9 Text card with display changed.</b><p>

cards throughout your Perseus session, but will return to the default
two-column setting when you quit HyperCard.<p>
