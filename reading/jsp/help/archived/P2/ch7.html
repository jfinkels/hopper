<br>
<p>

The Atlas is an interactive tool for investigating the geography of the Greek
world and the surrounding Mediterranean region. The Atlas has graphic drawings,
digital elevation models, satellite images, and three-dimensional topography
views. Various functions in the Atlas allow you to locate and plot sites,
compute distances between sites, identify sites within a region, examine
elevation and drainage, and zoom in and out to see maps of different scales. As
a geographic reference, the Atlas can be used in traditional ways, but its
content and design encourage more complex and interactive uses.

<a name="7.1">7.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE ATLAS
</a></h3>
<h4><a name="7.1.1">7.1.1 A DEFINITION OF TERMS
</a></h4>
The Atlas is a complex tool with several unique features. Here are some terms
used to describe the Atlas. <p>
"Projection" refers to the system used to translate locations on a (nearly)
spherical earth into the plane of a map. The large scale longitude-latitude
(lon-lat) map uses a Plate Carree projection. The other maps use the Universal
Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection system.<p>
<p>
"Coordinate system" refers to the system by which points on the current map are
located. In Perseus, all geographic data are recorded in longitude and latitude
coordinates, expressed in degrees (minutes, seconds) east of Greenwich, England
and north of the Equator. The large scale lon-lat map works directly with these
coordinates in a Plate Carree projection. The other maps use the UTM coordinate
system expressed in integers in a UTM projection. <p>
<p>
"Graphic Map Index" refers to the black and white line drawings that serve as
pointers and gateways to detailed maps. Typically, a map index shows a line
drawing of the Greek world overlaid with numerous rectangles. The rectangles
are active areas that, when clicked, open the respective detailed map in the
selected scale and theme (defined below).<p>
<p>
"Scale" refers to the meters-per-pixel ratio of the maps. Depending on the
current map, the scale may be 1300, 1000, 500, 250, 125, or 60 meters per
pixel. (A pixel is the unit of measure for a computer monitor.)<p>
<p>
"Theme" refers to the type of map selected, such as a color topography map. The
map themes are defined below. <p>
<p>
"Detailed maps" are the color maps and the black and white topography maps. <p>

<h4>
<a name="7.1.2">7.1.2 MAP THEMES
</a></h4>
Four map themes are used in the Atlas.<p>
<p>
Outline  maps: Large and small scale  black and white line drawings show an
outline of the coastline of the Greek world from Sicily and Magna Graecia to
Asia Minor. <p>
<p>
Black and white topography: This black and white line drawing shows elevation,
and resembles a standard paper topographic map, with contour lines showing 1000
foot intervals in elevation.<p>
<p>
Satellite images: These maps show a conventional representation in false-color
of satellite data and cover the Greek mainland. The three bands of satellite
data are shown in red, green, and blue.<p>
<p>
Color elevation maps with rivers: These maps have been created from digital
information on land elevation. A range of colors, from yellow to dark brown, is
used to describe elevation. These maps show streams and lakes overlaid on
topography.<p>

<h4>
<a name="7.1.3">7.1.3
COLOR ATLAS FEATURES
</a></h4>
The Graphic Map Index of the Greek world is the gateway to all color Atlas
features. The Graphic Map Index contains active rectangles superimposed on the
Greek world map. Each rectangle represents the size and location of a map in
the selected theme and scale. <p>
To see a map, choose an item from one of the pop-up tiles on the Graphic Map
Index. (The procedure is described in detail in <A HREF="#7.2">section 7.2</A>.) To return to the
Index, click <tt>Graphic index of maps</tt> on the Atlas Tools Palette. To move
to an adjacent topography map to the north, south, east, or west, click the
directional arrows around the magnifying glass icon. To move to the next
highest scale map in a theme, click once in one of the map's quadrants. To move
to the next lowest scale map in a theme, click on the minus sign inside the
magnifying glass icon.<p>
When you are viewing a topography map, you can plot sites, plot sites within a
region, and compute distances between points.<p>
A summary of features found in the color maps is shown in the table below:

sources.</b></CENTER>
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC6">Satellite
Images (False-Color Infrared)
</a></h5>
The satellite photography, shown as false-color infrared maps, covers the Greek
mainland and are available in four scales: 500, 250, 125, and 60 meters per
pixel. The maps show a standard coloration of three bands of satellite data
using red, green, and blue. Bright red areas reflect heavy vegetation, and blue
to gray areas indicate heavily urbanized areas.<p>
The false-color infrared maps are based on five regions in mainland Greece: <p>
Epirus (Albania/Illyria)<br>
NW Greece (Acarnania, Phocis, Aetolia, etc.)<br>
SE Greece (Attica, Boeotia, Euboea, Thessaly, etc.)<br>
Peloponnese, including Attica<br>
Macedonia/Thrace
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC7">Color
Elevation Maps with Rivers
</a></h5>
These color topography maps are based on the 15 regions used to divide the
black and white topography maps. The maps are digital elevation models that use
color to indicate topography. Topographic data in the black and white
topographic maps were used to interpolate values for the areas between the
contour lines, so that every point on the map has an elevation value. <p>
The key used to read elevations from the color elevation maps is available by
clicking <tt>Show DEM Key</tt> on the Atlas Tools Palette, lower right. A small
floating window with the color key and elevation scale appears. Hide the window
by clicking the close button on the Key.<p>
The color topography maps are available in three scales, 500, 250 and 125
meters per pixel. <p>

<h5>
<a name="RTFToC8">Sources
for Atlas Images
</a></h5>
The Atlas includes information from three kinds of sources:  the Digital Chart
of the World (DCW), the Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS), and printed
materials of varying quality.<p>
The DCW offers worldwide coverage of a variety of themes represented as vectors
in the Vector Product Format. For the Perseus Atlas, the most important themes
are topography and hydrography. The published accuracy of the DCW is roughly
1:1 million, but according to the developers of the DCW, the accuracy will be
substantially better in many parts of the world.<p>
The Landsat MSS sensors measure electromagnetic radiation at four different
points in the spectrum:  0.5-0.6 micrometers (blue); 0.6-0.7 mm (green);
0.7-0.8 mm (infrared); 0.8-1.1 mm (infrared).  Because different materials
reflect and absorb radiation in characteristic ways, these data provide
evidence of land cover. <p>
The Atlas includes a database of approximately 1900 sites, based on maps
published by the Greek Statistical Service, and on printed gazetteers.  The
Greek maps can be used reliably to within 30 seconds of longitude or latitude.
(At 39 degrees of latitude, very near the center of our core area, 30 seconds
of longitude represents about 720 meters on the ground.)
<HR>
<h3>
<a name="7.2">7.2 NAVIGATING THE ATLAS
</a></h3>
The Atlas comprises more than 1,000 map images. To navigate among them and find
the ones most useful to you, spend some time learning how the Atlas works. 
<h4>
<a name="7.2.1">7.2.1
GRAPHIC MAPS, GRAPHIC MAP INDEXES, AND DETAILED MAPS
</a></h4>
In broad terms, the Atlas maps can be categorized in three ways: as graphic
outline maps, Graphic Map Indexes, and detailed maps. There are two graphic
outline maps, the large- and small-scale lon-lat maps of the Greek world. Sites
can be plotted on both maps. <p>
The Graphic Map Indexes are gateways to detailed maps; they are analogous to
the map keys found in traditional print atlases (figure 7.1). The detailed maps
- color elevation, satellite image and black and white contour maps - come in
up to four scales. You choose which scale you want from the Graphic Map Index
(see below).<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/7.2.gif"><p>
<b>                         Figure 7.2 Map Key from a print atlas showing pages
containing detailed maps.</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>Use of a print atlas map key is intuitive; you find the tile
corresponding to the part of the world you want a detailed map of, and then
turn to the atlas page indicated by the number in the upper corner. Similarly,
each tile in the Perseus Graphic Map Index takes you to a detailed map, but
instead of turning pages, you choose the desired item from a pop-up menu. <p>
The following examples are arranged to show first how to display the various
map themes, then how to use the specialized map tools.<p>
&gt;	Enter the Perseus Atlas environment.<p>
From the Gateway, click the Atlas icon. Or from anywhere in Perseus, choose
<tt>Atlas</tt> from the Links menu. Your point of entry into the Atlas is the
Small outline map of the Greek world (figure 7.3).<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/7.3.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 7.3 Small Outline Map of the Greek World with Atlas Tools Palette,
Scrolling Window, and Navigator Palette.</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>Notice that a new floating window appears, the Atlas Tools Palette
(figure 7.3), and that a new menu, Atlas, appears on the menu bar.<p>
&gt;	Go to the Large outline map of the Greek world. <p>
On the Atlas Tools Palette a magnifying glass, with plus and minus signs in the
lens. To bring up the Large outline map of the Greek world, click the plus sign
on the magnifying glass icon. You can toggle from Small to Large outline maps
by clicking the plus and minus signs.<p>
&gt;	Go to the Graphic Map Indexes. <p>
From either the Small or Large outline map of the Greek world, click the button
<tt>Graphic Index</tt> of<tt> Maps </tt>on the Atlas Tools Palette. An outline
map appears with active rectangles, or tiles, overlaid (figure 7.4). The title
field of the Atlas Tools Palette now reads <tt>Map Index.</tt>Note that as you
move the mouse over the tiles they become highlighted.<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/7.4.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 7.4 Index of Maps with tile pop-up menu.</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>&gt;	Go to the detailed maps. <p>
Move the mouse to the tile over the Attic peninsula (middle row, third from
left). Hold the mouse down to bring up a pop-up menu. To see a detailed map,
choose one of the pop-up menu items. The items available are Color Elevation
Map with Rivers, Satellite Image and Black-and-white Contour Map. The
interpretation of the detailed maps is explained below.<p>
You can toggle between Satellite Image maps and Color Elevation maps by
clicking the button on the Atlas Tools Palette. This action will preserve sites
plotted on one of the color maps. However, it is necessary to return to the
Graphic Map Index to go to a Black-and-whicte Contour map. Any plotted sites
will be lost unless you first save them by clicking the Search Saver icon on
the Navigator Palette. To replot the sites, choose <tt>Plot Sites in Search
Saver</tt> from the Atlas menu. To return to the Graphic Map Index, click the
button <tt>Graphic Index of Maps</tt> the Atlas Tools Palette (figure 7.5). <p>

ATLAS TOOLS
</a></h4>
The Atlas has unique tools for navigating among the themes, scales, and maps.
The tool set includes the Atlas Tools Palette with its special tools, the Atlas
menu, which includes the Atlas Browser and the various customizing settings.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC12">Atlas
Tools Palette
</a></h5>
The Atlas Tools Palette (figure 7.6) is a floating window that provides
controls to navigate the Atlas. It also gives information about the current
map. Sites for the current map, their coordinates and distance computation
between sites are reported in the Atlas Tools Palette (described below). <p>
The scale bar shows the distance taken up by one hundred pixels of the
monitor's  screen. The distance represented by the scale is shown above it in
kilometers and changes depending on the scale of the map.<p>
The Atlas Tools Palette has an information field at the top that reports the
theme of the map you are viewing, and below it a button to go directly to the
Graphic  Map Index.<p>
<CENTER>          
<IMG src="/img/help/7.6.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 7.6 Atlas Tools Palette</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>The directional reference on the map is indicated by the arrow labeled
"N" for north. This orientation is constant.<p>
The small magnifying glass surrounded by directional arrows is a navigation
tool for moving among maps in the current theme. To change the scale of a map
within a theme, click the plus sign (+) in the magnifying glass and you will
zoom in to the next larger scale of the current map, if one is available. Click
the minus sign (-) and you will zoom out to the next smaller scale of the
current map, if one is available. <p>
The detailed maps come in four scales: 500 meters per pixel, 250 meters per
pixel, 125  meters per pixel and 60 meters per pixel. A pixel is a dot on the
monitor of your computer. Since monitors vary from workstation to workstation,
the representation of a geographical distance will also vary. However, you can
readily get a sense of distance in the Atlas from the kilometer scale on the
Atlas Tools Palette; its length is always 100 pixels, and the equivalent of 100
pixels in kilometers is displayed above the scale for each map.<p>
Not every theme is available in each of the four scales. Satellite images are
the only theme coming in the 60 meter/pixel resolution.<p>
&gt;	See the four map scales available from the Graphic Map Index.<p>
Enter the Graphic Map Index. There will be 15 tiles imposed upon regions
covered by detailed maps. By default the scale displayed is the smallest, 500
meters per pixel, shown on the title bar (and on Atlas Tools Palette when the
detailed map is displayed). The figure 260 km which you see currently displayed
on the Atlas Tools Palette is the scale for the entire outline map.<p>
Increase the scale by clicking the plus sign of the magnifying glass icon on
the Atlas Tools Palette once. There will now be 56 tiles imposed upon regions
covered by detailed maps. Each tile represents a detailed map at a scale of 250
meters per pixel.<p>
Note that each of the former tiles is now subdivided into four tiles, with the
exception of the tile over the upper Bosphoros (250 meter/pixel resolution is
not available for that region).<p>
Increase the scale to 125, then 60 meters per pixel by clicking on the plus
sign of the magnifying glass icon. Note that the number of tiles on the Graphic
Map Index again  increases by a factor of four. <p>
You can decrease the scale back to 125, 250 and 500 meters/pixel by clicking on
the minus sign on the magnifying glass.<p>
&gt;	See detailed maps in the four available scales. This example will use the
Satellite image theme and zoom in on the Isthmus of Corinth.<p>
Not all themes are available for each scale. The pop-up menu for each tile of
the Graphic Map Index displays the themes available.<p>
From the Graphic Map index at 500 meters/pixel scale, move the mouse to the
tile over the Corinthiad (second row from top, third tile from left). Choose
<tt>Satellite image</tt> from the pop-up menu. The satellite image will appear.
The Isthmus of Corinth is the neck of land in the lower left quadrant
connecting the Attic peninsula above with the Peloponnesus below. <p>
To zoom in to the 250 meters/pixel scale, click the + sign on the magnifying
glass icon on the Atlas Tools Palette. The cursor will now change to a
magnifying glass. Now move the cursor over the Isthmus of Corinth and click it.
The 250 meter/pixel satellite image will appear, with the Isthmus of Corinth in
the lower right quadrant. <p>
Zoom in to 125 meters/pixel by clicking the Isthmus; click the Isthmus again to
reach the 60 meters/pixel map. <p>
You can decrease the scale by clicking on the minus sign in the magnifying
glass on the Atlas Tools Palette.<p>
&gt;	Use the directional arrows on the Atlas Tools Palette to go to adjacent
maps in the same theme.<p>
Four arrows at 90 degree intervals surround the magnifying glass. These
directional arrows, when clicked, move you to an adjacent map in the current
scale (north, south, east, and west, respectively, for up, down, right, left).
By using the directional arrows, you can skip the step of returning to the
index to see an adjacent map. 
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC13">Show/Hide
Tools toggle
</a></h5>
For the following examples, use the Small Outline Map of the Greek World. If
you are already inside the Atlas, click the button <tt>Graphic Index of
Maps</tt> on the Atlas Tools Palette, then click the button <tt>Outline
Map</tt>. Else, from the Gateway, click the Atlas icon; from anywhere in
Perseus, choose <tt>Atlas</tt> from the Links menu. <p>
The Show tools/Hide tools toggle switch alternately shows and hides three
additional map tools, Plot Sites, Plot Sites in Area and Compute Distances.
These tools appear in the interface as round buttons. When the map tools are
showing, they are attached to the lower part of the Atlas Tools Palette. <p>
&gt;	Click the Show tools toggle on the Atlas Tools Palette. <p>
The Palette will expand to show the three buttons that operate the tools
(figure 7.6).
<h6>
<a name="RTFToC14">Plot
Sites 
</a></h6>
Maps in Perseus appear without political boundaries or other indications of
human settlement. The Plot Sites tool allows you to plot sites on a map by
selecting sites from the scrolling field Select Sites, lower left. The Select
Site list shows in alphabetical order the sites that can be plotted on the
current map. The list of sites ranges from more than 2,000 sites that can be
plotted on the large scale lon-lat map to 2 or 3 sites on some detailed maps of
sparsely populated areas.<p>
&gt;	Plot the site of Delphi.<p>
Make sure that the Atlas Tools Palette is toggled to <tt>Show Tools</tt>, and
click the button <tt>Plot Sites</tt>.<p>
The scroll bar at the right side of the Select Sites list provides a quick way
to move through the list. (Remember that you can drag the scroll indicator up
or down to move quickly in a list, rather than moving line by line.)<p>
Click <tt>Delphi</tt> in the Select Site list, then click the button <tt>Plot
selected sites</tt>. The site is marked with a dot; the site name may be
dragged to another location on the map. You may need to drag the Atlas Tools
Palette out of the way in order to see the plotted sites. <p>
If you want to plot a number of sites -<p>
- shift-click (click while holding down the shift key) to select a continuous
range of sites.<p>
- command-click (click while holding down the command key) to select a
discontinuous range of sites.<p>
When your selection is ready, click the button <tt>Plot selected sites.</tt><p>
<tt></tt>The limit on the number of sites that may be displayed at one time is
fifty.<p>
The site coordinates appear in the scrolling field on the right and are given
either in lon-lat degrees or UTM (explained in Atlas Settings, below).
<h6>
<a name="RTFToC15">Plot
Sites in Area 
</a></h6>
This feature plots all known sites within a rectangular region that you define.
<p>
&gt;	Define an area in Thrace for the Atlas to plot sites.<p>
If you have been following the previous example, first clear old sites from the
map by choosing <tt>Clear plotted sites on this map </tt>from the Atlas menu.
Please be sure that the Atlas Tools Palette is toggled to <tt>Show
Tools</tt>.<p>
Click the button <tt>Plot sites in Area</tt>. <p>
Three changes now take place in the Atlas Tools Palette: the scrolling field
lower left becomes Sites in This Area; a new array of buttons appears lower
right; and a message appears to the right of the radio buttons prompting you to
click the button Define Area (figure 7.7).<p>
                         
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/7.7.gif"><p>

<b></b>Click the button <tt>Define Area</tt>. You will now receive the
following prompt: "Click and drag on map to define area." <p>
For this exercise, a sparsely populated region was chosen because on a small
scale map, the plotted sites tend to get overcrowded. For best results,
therefore, use the Plot sites in area feature on a larger scale map, and be
careful not to choose too big or densely populated an area, because the maximum
number of sites that the Atlas can plot is fifty.<p>
Select approximately the area shown in figure 7.8.<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/7.8.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 7.8 Thrace with area selected.</b><p></CENTER>

KNOWN BUG: You cannot scroll down the Sites in area field, though the Atlas
sites will plot them all.
<h6>
<a name="RTFToC16">Compute
Distance
</a></h6>
This feature allows you to compute the distance in straight lines between two
or more points on a map. It is available on both the black and white and color
maps.<p>
&gt;	Compute the distance of the paraplous from Iapygeum to Syracuse, via
Kroton, Locri and Rhegion.<p>
From the Small outline map, plot the sites Iapygeum, Kroton, Locri, Rhegion and
Syracuse according to the instructions above (figure 7.10).<p>

SCROLL WINDOW
</a></h4>
The scroll window is a floating window with a rectangle inside it. The
rectangle represents the screen size of the current HyperCard stack. This tool
is useful when a HyperCard stack is larger than the current monitor size, such
as the black and white line drawings in the Atlas. When you place the cursor in
the center of the rectangle, it changes to a hand icon. By dragging the
rectangle within the constraints of the floating window, you can see the other
parts of the card that were previously off the screen. You can also drag the
sides of the rectangle to make the current stack wider or narrower, and you can
drag the top or bottom of the rectangle to make the current stack taller or
shorter. <p>
If you need the scroll window to move around the graphic index or other black
and white map, choose <tt>Scroll</tt> from the Go menu, or press Command-e.
Press Command-e again to make the scroll window disappear. More detailed
instructions for using the scroll window are presented in <A HREF="ch4.html#4.1.3">chapter 4.1.3</A>.

BLACK AND WHITE ATLAS FEATURES
</a></h3>
The Atlas uses black and white drawings to provide an overall glance at the
geography of the Greek world and to serve as indexes to color maps. 
<h4>
<a name="7.3.1">7.3.1
OUTLINE MAPS
</a></h4>
The Small and Large Outline maps enclose the coastline of the Greek world, from
Sicily to Western Asia Minor, and from Campania to Crete, in a black and white
line drawing. The site list has approximately 1,600 entries, which can be
plotted on the outline map. <p>
The Small outline  map is the default selection when you open the Atlas.
Plotting sites on it is a fast way to locate sites in their geographical
context. <p>
When you are viewing the Small and Large outline maps, you can plot sites, plot
sites within a region within a region which you define, and compute distances
between points. 
<h4>
<a name="7.3.2">7.3.2
BLACK AND WHITE CONTOUR MAPS
</a></h4>
The black and white contour (topography) maps are offered in one scale, 250
meters per pixel. Each one shows a region approximately the size of Sicily or
the Peloponnese. Lines represent topographic contours at an interval of 1,000
feet.<p>
The black and white topography maps cover 15 regions of roughly 200 by 300
kilometers each:<br>
Campania<br>
Apulia<br>
Bruttium (Calabria)<br>
Sicily<br>
Epirus (Albania/Illyria)<br>
NW Greece (Acarnania, Phocis, Aetolia, etc.)<br>
SE Greece (Attica, Boeotia, Euboea, Thessaly, etc.)<br>
Peloponnese, including Attica<br>
Cyclades<br>
Macedonia/Thrace<br>
Marmara Sea<br>
Troad<br>
Ionia/Lydia<br>
Caria/Lycia<br>
Crete<br>
This same division of regions is also used for the color maps. <p>
The Black and White Contour Maps are available from Graphic Map Index only when
it is set at the 260 km. scale. To see a topography map, choose <tt>Black and
White Contour Maps</tt> from one of the pop-up tiles on the Graphic Map Index.
To return to the Index, click <tt>Graphic index of maps</tt> on the Atlas Tools
Navigator. To move to an adjacent topography map to the north, south, east, or
west, click the directional arrows around the magnifying glass icon.<p>
When you are viewing a topography map, you can plot sites, plot sites within a
region, and compute distances between points.

THE ATLAS AND MEMORY ISSUES
</a></h3>
Your ability to use the full features of the Atlas depends on the amount of
random access memory (RAM) in your computer and the memory partition allocated
to HyperCard. Color images and color windows require more memory than textual
resources and black and white graphics. With a color-intensive resource such as
the Atlas, more RAM and a fast computer will enhance its performance.<p>
Every Macintosh with 5 MB RAM alloted to the Perseus Player can run the basic
Atlas, meaning the color/black and white Atlas features, though it is
preferable to have at least 8 MB RAM. The Computing Distances feature uses
memory quickly, and users with less than 3 MB RAM who try to compute distances
will get an error message, "Not enough memory to use the Painting Tools."
(Consult <A HREF="ch2.html">chapter 2</A>, "Setup," for a more detailed description of hardware and
software requirements and memory issues.) <p>
Black and white outline maps are part of a HyperCard stack. Color maps are
drawn on the screen in a separate window. To achieve efficiency in memory and
speed, leave the color window open only for as long as you are using color
views in the Atlas, because the current color image will be replaced by your
next selection. You can click another window to bring that window to the
foreground, leaving the color map in the background. When you are finished with
the Atlas, you must close the color map window by clicking the close box in the
upper left corner. To avoid memory shortages, however, close all color windows
when you no longer need them.<p> <p><A HREF="ch6.html"><IMG ALIGN=Left src="/img/help/la.gif" WIDTH=75 BORDER=3 ALT="Go Back"></A><A HREF="ch8.html"><IMG ALIGN=Right src="/img/help/ra.gif" WIDTH=75 BORDER=3 ALT="Go Forward"></A><br>
