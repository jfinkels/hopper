<h3><A NAME="2.1">2.1 HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS</A></h3>
Perseus requires certain hardware and software elements. To some extent, the
requirements vary according to technical resources and the primary use of
Perseus in your configuration.<p>
Users of Macintosh computers belonging to the PowerPC family, please take note.
A problem with the most recent  PowerPC machines, i.e., those shipped as of
Fall, 1995 with 8 MB of RAM installed, is that the system software eats up a
tremendous amout of RAM, leaving only about 3.5 MB for Perseus. Thus, since
Perseus 2.0 requires 5 MB of RAM to run well, you will need to add more memory.
See the discussion on SIMMs chips in <A HREF="#2.2">section 2.2</A> below.
<h4><A NAME="2.1.1">2.1.1 HARDWARE</A></h4>
<h5><a name="RTFToC4">Macintosh computer  </a></h5>
Perseus runs on Macintosh computers and is distributed as a set of HyperCard
stacks. HyperCard is a software foundation for building computer applications.
As a sophisticated tool with a large data base, Perseus is a high-end use of
the HyperCard program. Formerly, Perseus required a fast computer to operate
efficiently, but now you can achieve reasonable performance with almost any new
Macintosh model.<p>
Table 2.1 gives you a quick indication of the Macintosh models capable of
running Perseus. You should also consult the more detailed technical
requirements that follow.<p>

<CENTER><b>Table 2-1.  Macintosh Models for Using Perseus</b></CENTER><p>
<b></b>Smaller and older Macintosh computers, such as the Mac Plus, Mac SE, and
Mac Classic, are not recommended for use with Perseus because of their small
9-inch screens and their inability to display color digital images. The
Macintosh Color Classic can display color images but is slow and has a small
screen. <p>
The Macintosh computer you select must meet certain minimum technical demands.
An optimum configuration is one with a Macintosh Quadra, Centris or PowerPC
computer and 24-bit color display. Detailed requirements for Perseus are shown
in Table 2-2, below.<p>

<CENTER><b>Table 2-2.  Computer Specifications for Using Perseus</b></CENTER>
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC5">Hard
disk size 
</a></h5>
Perseus requires at least 7 MB of free space available on your hard disk to run
in the most basic configuration. This space is taken up by the Local Stacks
folder, copied over from the CD-ROM during installation, and containing
operating instructions for your computer. The remaining Perseus information is
stored on the CD-ROMs, so it requires relatively little other hard disk
space.<p>
More hard disk space is required if you modify the primary configuration of
Perseus by relocating CD-ROM information to the hard disk. This step speeds up
the performance of Perseus, but it also substantially increases the required
hard disk space (see <A HREF="#2.2">section 2.2</A>).
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC6">Computer
Monitor
</a></h5>
You need a color monitor to use Perseus. (Perseus will also run on a
black-and-white monitor, but this configuration will not allow the display of
any color images.) Most Macintosh computers with color monitors are configured
to display 16-bit or 8-bit color. The display mode of the monitor can be
verified and reset through the Monitors Control Panel, available from the Apple
menu. Eight-bit mode displays 256 colors, 16-bit mode displays
thousands of colors, and 24-bit mode displays millions of colors.
<h6>
<a name="RTFToC7">Color
Depth
</a></h6>
Most color images in Perseus are 24-bit color images. Although the images look
best when displayed in 24-bit color, they can be displayed in 8-bit and 16-bit
color mode, with some corresponding degradation of image quality. <p>
Many newer Macintosh models come with 16- or 24-bit color, e.g., the Performa
636. Other recent Macintosh models use VRAM (video RAM) expansion kits to
upgrade the display capability to 24-bit color. Older Macintosh models use
display cards to upgrade the display capability to 24-bit color.<p>
When you are evaluating the monitor and color display requirements for your
Perseus configuration, consider the audience who will be using the program. If
the main use of Perseus will be the primary texts and philological tools, you
may not need the ability to display images using millions of colors. If the
main use is for art history or archaeological inquiry, you should probably have
a configuration that provides for thousands or millions of colors (16-bit or
24-bit mode). 
<h6>
<a name="RTFToC8">Monitor
Size
</a></h6>
Although a 14-inch color monitor will work well with Perseus, large monitors
(16-21 inches) offer several advantages that may be appropriate for your needs.
Large monitors allow many more windows to be simultaneously visible, and they
are more convienent for the oversized images found in the Perseus Atlas and
architectural site plans.<p>
Another way to expand the available screen size is to use two monitors placed
next to each other. The expanded screen size shows more windows and images
simultaneously. In this configuration, one monitor can be color and one can be
black and white. The computer treats the two monitors as one screen, where
windows can be dragged from one screen to the other. 
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC9">Apple-compatible
CD-ROM drive
</a></h5>
Both the Comprehensive and Concise Editions of Perseus 2.0 are CD-ROM-based
programs, and a CD-ROM drive that is compatible with Apple Macintosh computers
is necessary to read the Perseus compact discs. Various CD-ROM drives are
available, including internal and external models. CD-ROM drives vary in their
performance, which is measured by access speed (in milliseconds) and transfer
rate (in kilobytes per second, or KBps). As Perseus 2.0 goes to press, some
CD-ROM drives have achieved transfer rates greater than 300 KBps and average
access times under 300 milliseconds. The faster the drive, the better Perseus
will perform. There are also ways to make your CD-ROM drive work faster by
using software enhancements (see <A HREF="#2.1.2">section 2.1.2</A>). <p>
Although the Comprehensive Edition is a four-CD set, you do not need multiple
CD-ROM drives to use it. Instead, the Perseus software keeps track of requests
for data located on CD-ROMs other than the one currently in the drive, and it
will prompt you to swap CD-ROMs (see <A HREF="ch5.html#5.4">chapter 5.4</A>). If you have more than one
CD-ROM drive, however, you can use them to reduce the amount of CD-ROM swapping
required. Multiple CD-ROM drives are "daisy-chained" together, with each one
appearing as a separate drive on the Macintosh desktop.<p>
To connect the CD-ROM drive to your computer, you need a SCSI (Small Computer
System Interface) cable, which is normally provided with the CD-ROM drive. You
may also need an SCSI terminator, if you do not already have a terminated SCSI
device attached to your Macintosh. Consult the technical documentation for your
CD-ROM drive for more information on connecting the drive to your computer.
(See also CD-ROM software drivers and accelerators, below.)
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC10">Videodisc
player and monitor (optional)
</a></h5>
A videodisc player is needed only if you wish to use the Perseus videodisc
instead of or in addition to the digitized images available on the Perseus
CD-ROMs. The videodisc contains almost all of the images available on the
CD-ROM, and it contains a short sequence of motion video and narration.<p>
Possible options for the player include: Pioneer 4200, Pioneer 6000A, Pioneer
6010A, Sony LDP 1200, Sony 1500, Sony 2000, and Hitachi 9550. Any standard
video or TV monitor will work, but models with video input jacks are much
easier to use than models without such jacks. <p>
You will need audiovisual cables to connect the videodisc player to the monitor
and a computer interface cable to connect the player to the Macintosh. The
player-to-monitor cable is a standard one if the monitor has built-in jacks,
and the right connectors may be bought at any electronics store. The  computer
interface cable should be purchased with the player. They can also be purchased
from some specialized dealers<p>
Each player is different, and cables are not interchangeable. For example, a
cable made for a Pioneer videodisc player will not work with a Sony videodisc
player.
<h4><A NAME="2.1.2">2.1.2 SOFTWARE</A></h4>
Perseus requires several software elements. Make sure you have each of these
before you install Perseus.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC12">System
7
</a></h5>
Perseus 2.0 requires the Apple system softwre version 7.0 or later. Version 2.0
of Perseus takes advantage of features specifically offered by System 7, such
as QuickTime.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC13">Perseus
Player, HyperCard and HyperCard Player
</a></h5>
It is no longer necessary to run Perseus under the application HyperCard,
because Perseus 2.0 is distributed along with a standalone Home stack, called
Perseus Player. HyperCard 2.3 is still necessary for writing extensions to
Perseus, and still must be used to run Perseus 1.0. In the past, Macintosh
computers were distributed with the HyperCard application. More recently,
Macintoshes were distributed with a limited version of HyperCard, called
HyperCard Player. Stacks written as extensions of Perseus and Perseus 1.0 will
not run under HyperCard Player, because it sets the user lever to Read Only. If
HyperCard Player is on your Macintosh and you wish to run Perseus 1.0 or a
Perseus extension, it is recommended that you archive or delete HyperCard
Player and replace it with the full HyperCard 2.3 application. You can buy
HyperCard from a software distributor.<p>
The Perseus Installer software will automatically set the memory partition of
Perseus Player to the minimum amount required for Perseus (see <A HREF="#2.3">section 2.3</A>).
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC14">GreekKeys
7.0 (for typing accented Greek)
</a></h5>
Perseus supports the SMK GreekKeys 7.0 character set for displaying Greek
characters on the screen. You can read, copy, and paste Greek text in Perseus
without GreekKeys 7.0, but to type accented Greek the character set must be
installed in your system. This is strongly recommended, because the ability to
type accented Greek is necessary for accurate searches of parsed Greek words.<p>
GreekKeys 7.0 is a keyboard program, designed for the Macintosh, that enables
you to type accented Greek letter fonts with a standard Macintosh keyboard.
Greek letters are paired with keys on the keyboard, and diacritics are created
by pressing the Option key in combination with a letter key.<p>
Perseus does not hold any rights to GreekKeys and therefore cannot distribute
it. GreekKeys 7.0 may be purchased from Scholar's Press Customer Services, P.O.
Box 6996, Alpharetta, GA 30239-6996, 1-800-437-6692.<p>
There is a brief discussion on typing Greek in <A HREF="ch8b.html#8.4.1">section 8.4.1</A>. The Greek
alphabet, its transliteration into Roman characters, and its GreekKeys
equivalents may be found in Online help under the Stack Topic, The Greek
Alphabet.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC15">CD-ROM
software drivers and accelerators
</a></h5>
Your computer needs a system software extension to read the CD-ROM drive. This
software is normally provided with your CD-ROM drive. <p>
System software enhancements can also be installed to accelerate the
performance of the CD-ROM. These enhancements increase the access speed and/or
transfer rate between the computer and the CD-ROM drive. Some enhancements can
increase the speed by 50 percent or more. A list of some CD-acceleration
utilities is presented below, although it should not be considered
comprehensive. Investigate the availability of CD-ROM system enhancements
through your system administrator or local software distributor.<p>
The Perseus Project has not thoroughly tested these enhancements and does not
guarantee their performance or reliability. Some software builds permanent
files which must be discarded before upgrading from version 1.0.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC16">QuickTime</a></h5>
QuickTime(TM) is an Apple system extension that comes with the Apple System 7
Software. It is a software architecture that defines ways in which digitized
video is compressed, decompressed, and synchronized with sound. Perseus relies
on QuickTime to display digitized images that have been compressed in the JPEG
format. In most instances, QuickTime will already be installed in the
Extensions folder of System 7. If QuickTime is not present in your Extensions
folder, check your system diskettes for a copy and install it. The absence of
QuickTime results in unusual image displays, showing the QuickTime symbol
rather than the photograph. At the time of Perseus 2.0 publication, the current
release of QuickTime is version 2.0 . 
<hr><h3><A NAME="2.2">2.2 CONFIGURATIONS FOR PERSEUS</A></h3>
Perseus is primarily meant to be used from the CD-ROMs on which it is
published, but it can also be used in other system configurations, such as hard
disks and networks. The factors that might influence your choice of Perseus
configurations are the number of intended users, the resources available for
hardware, and the technical skills to set up alternate configurations. Some
alternate configurations and their strengths and limitations are listed
below.<p>
When you are using a single computer, there are several ways to optimize it for
Perseus. The primary way is to select a fast computer (such as a Centris) and
fast CD-ROM drive. As of this writing, the Apple CD-300S is a good choice for a
CD-ROM drive, with an access speed of 300 KBps. <p>
You can also add random-access memory (RAM) to the total available memory. More
RAM will allow you to allocate a larger memory partition to Perseus Player, so
that you can open more stacks and images at the same time. The preferred way to
do this is to add Single Inline Memory Modules (SIMMs). Beyond 16 MB the
computer will not run any faster; the advantage to expanding RAM above that
level is the ability to run other applications simultaneously with Perseus. You
can try using System 7's virtual memory facility to expand the total available
RAM, although results produced by this method are significantly slower than
adding hardware RAM. The RAM partition of virtual memory cannot exceed the
amount of free space on the computer hard disk. <p>
Another way to optimize your system is to place frequently-used parts of
Perseus on the hard disk, which allows faster access than the CD-ROM drive. The
size of the hard disk will determine how much information can be relocated. For
more information on this option, see Installation below.<p>
You may also use Perseus in a network configuration. The contents of the
Perseus CD-ROMs or the CD-ROMs themselves can be placed on dedicated file
servers accessed through workstations linked to the network. If you plan a
network configuration for Perseus, be sure to have enough disk space to
accommodate the information on all the CD-ROMs of Perseus, about 2 gigabytes.
<p>
Advantages of a network configuration are that several people can use Perseus
at the same time, access time will likely be faster (depending on the network),
and you might save money on hardware. (If you run Perseus on a network, you
must have a network license.  Contact Yale University Press for network
licensing information.) <p>
The information below provides some detail on alternative configurations for
Perseus. The most effective way to use the information is to skim it for an
overall understanding, then read it in greater detail when you have become
familiar with Perseus. If you are a novice computer user or a first-time user
of Perseus, you should also read the rest of this chapter for more complete
information. If you are an experienced computer/Perseus user, review this
section for suggestions on ways to improve your configuration. 
<h4><A NAME="2.2.1">2.2.1 USING PERSEUS ON A SINGLE SYSTEM</A></h4>
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC19">No Reconfiguration
</a></h5>
The simplest configuration of Perseus is when individuals or groups use the
program at a single computer using the Perseus CD-ROMs. The advantages are that
a large amount of information is accessible via a single workstation, a
relatively small amount of hard disk space is required, and the system need not
be dedicated to Perseus. The disadvantages are that CD-ROM access can be slower
than optimized access on a hard disk, and only one person or group at a time
can use Perseus. <p>
This configuration requires a computer, color monitor, and CD-ROM drive, at
minimum. In a typical configuration, an individual runs Perseus by using the
minimum required files from the hard disk (about 7 MB) and drawing all other
information and images from the CD-ROMs. <p>
If this is your configuration, you should consider adding CD-ROM accelerator
software to speed up performance of the CD-ROM drive. These enhancements are
described in <A HREF="#2.1.2">section 2.1.2</A>.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC20">Moderate
Reconfiguration
</a></h5>
<h6>
<a name="RTFToC21">Copying
folders to the hard disk
</a></h6>
You can improve the speed and performance of Perseus on a single computer by
relocating some folders beyond the minimum required from the CD-ROMs to the
local hard disk. The advantage is faster operation, because a hard disk can be
accessed more quickly than a CD-ROM. The disadvantage of relocating folders is
that a large amount of space on the hard disk will be occupied by Perseus.<p>
The Installer automatically decides which folders to copy to your hard disk.
<h6>
<a name="RTFToC22">Using
multiple CD-ROM drives
</a></h6>
A different way to configure a single system is to use more than one CD-ROM
drive. The advantage of adding drives is that you will spend less time swapping
CD-ROMs, because more than one CD-ROM is available simultaneously. The
disadvantages are continued slow access of the CD and the expense of adding
another hardware item to your configuration. If your configuration uses
multiple CD-ROM drives, consider adding the CD-acceleration utilities that
speed up access to the CD-ROM (described in <A HREF="#2.1.2">section 2.1.2</A>).
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC23">Advanced
Reconfiguration - for System Administrators
</a></h5>
Caveat: The Perseus Installer software will not do this procedure for you. We
advise you not to attempt this reconfiguration unless you are sure that it is
necessary.<p>
An advanced reconfiguration of a Perseus system involves moving selected
elements of Perseus to the hard disk based on the information that will be used
most frequently. This step is like the previous suggestion for moderate
reconfiguration but it requires a more selective process of relocating Perseus
elements and a firm understanding of search paths. The advantage is faster
operation. The disadvantages are a more demanding installation procedure and
the need to know which parts of Perseus you will use most often. <p>
Perseus files consist of HyperCard stacks, drawings, photographic images,
QuickTime movies, and data base files. In the moderate reconfiguration
described above, you move entire folders containing Perseus elements. In the
more advanced reconfiguration, you go through a more selective process to
identify stacks, images, and data base files to copy from the CD-ROM to the
hard disk. <p>
If you call the same images repeatedly in your use of Perseus, you may want to
copy some image folders to the hard disk. Images are grouped in folders
according to their collection, and must be copied only one folder at a time.
Section A.1 of the appendix contains a list of folder names and their contents.
Identify the image folders you want to relocate and copy them to the hard disk.
Copying folders from the CD-ROMs to the hard disk requires an adjustment to the
Home stack to change the search paths. Read the subsequent section in this
chapter for information on the Home stack and search paths. <p>
Folders containing images may be copied to the hard disk, but do not remove
images from their folders or rename them, or else Perseus will be unable to
find them.<p>
If you use the same elements of Perseus repeatedly, for example, selected
authors, you may want to move the pertinent data base file from the Text
Databases folder on the CD-ROM to the hard disk. This step will speed up access
to the selected elements of Perseus. Just as you must change the Home stack
search paths when you relocate an image folder, you must also change a special
Perseus search path when you relocate a database file. <A HREF="ch10.html#10.5.4">Section 10.5.4</A>, Detailed
Configuration, offers more information on how to change the file data base.
This type of modification should be undertaken only after you are comfortable
with file names, disk locations, and search paths.<p>
These configuration strategies are best suited to the single-user,
single-computer model. In many cases, particularly in instructional settings,
more than one person or group will need to use Perseus at the same time. For
solutions, read the network configuration descriptions below.
<h4><a name="2.2.2">2.2.2 USING PERSEUS ON A NETWORK
</a></h4>
The purpose of a network is to share applications and data among several users
at several workstations. File servers store the information, and local
computers provide access to the shared information. Perseus can be used on a
network to centralize access to the Perseus data and eliminate the need for
redundant set-ups. Remember that network use of Perseus requires a network
license from Yale University Press.<p>
There are two main types of network protocols: LocalTalk and Ethernet.
LocalTalk is an inexpensive network option, but it is slow. Ethernet is much
faster, and many recent Macintosh models have built-in Ethernet cabability, but
it requires more expensive cabling. Ethernet can support many more simultaneous
users than LocalTalk.<p>
Several CD-ROM drives can be placed on a network as servers. This is of
advantage only if you already own the CD-ROM drives. With the price of ROM
falling, it is cheaper and faster to copy the contents of the CD-ROMs onto
large hard disks that will be file server(s).  (A 2.0 gigabyte drive can be
bought for around $1000, 4.0 gigabytes for around $1700.) You must have hard
disk space for approximately 1.8 gigabytes (2,000 megabytes) of data from the
CD-ROMs. <p>
A combination of CD-ROM drives and hard disks may be used. Just make sure that
there are enough CD-ROM drives and/or hard disk space to provide access to all
information in Perseus at the same time. <p>
When you copy Perseus from the CD-ROMs to the file server disks, make sure the
folders retain their original names. List the disk name and folder locations in
the local Home stacks. All HyperCard stacks that are originally locked should
remain locked. <p>
The Home stack on each computer must list the image folders, the Atlas folder
and Local Stacks. Everything elso is listed in the Gateway. The most efficient
method of ensuring an accurate Home stack is to modify one Home stack with all
the appropriate search paths for the file server folders. Copy that Home stack
on each local computer, and make the appropriate changes to each local Home
stack to reflect the name of the local hard drive.<p>
A common challenge in network configurations is the security and stability of
the data. Network administrators will be aware of software that protects the
data from unintended modification and intentional tampering. For Perseus to
work, however, it is essential that the stacks in the folder Local Stacks
remain unlocked. 
<hr><h3>
<a name="2.3">2.3
 QUICK STARTUP
</a></h3>
NOTE: Perseus users who are updating Perseus from version 1.0 to 2.0 should
archive or delete all Perseus 1.0 files from the hard disk upon converting
their version 1.0 Paths to version 2.0 (Path conversion is discussed in <A HREF="ch10.html#10.2.8">chapter
10.2.8</A>).  Some files have duplicate names. The version 1.0 files may create
problems if they remain on the hard disk when you use version 2.0. <i></i><p>
<i></i>Follow these instructions to get Perseus 2.0 running right away. More
detailed installation and startup instructions are given in <A HREF="#2.4">section 2.4</A> .<p>
The following steps assume a familiarity with Macintosh hardware and operating
system. Also, these instructions apply only if you are using Perseus on a
single system, not networked. If you are using a videodisc player, follow the
hardware instructions in <A HREF="#2.4.1">section 2.4.1</A> and the Settings intructions in 
 <A HREF="#2.4.2">section 2.4.2</A>.<p>
* Switch on the CD-ROM drive (if it is an external one) and the videodisc
player (if using one), boot up the computer and load the CD-ROM Perseus Disk 1
(or the Concise Edition Disk).<p>
<p>
Be sure to turn on the CD-ROM drive and videodisc player before turning on the
Macintosh.<p>
NOTE: If you will be swapping CD-ROMs, please be sure to turn off File Sharing
in the Control Panels of your Macintosh. Otherwise the Mac will not eject the
cd.<p>
* Create a new folder on your hard disk to contain Perseus software to be
copied to your disk. Name it <tt>Perseus 2.0.</tt>(or whatever else you want,

INSTALLATION
</a></h4>
Custom Installation is available on the second card of the Installer stack for
System Administrators putting all or some of Perseus on a server. All of
Perseus requires 1.8 GB on a hard disk. This procedure configures the Gateway
to find the various Perseus resources. All copying from cd to hard disk must be
done by the user.<p>
* Make sure you have copied the folder <tt>Local Stacks</tt> from Perseus CD 1
to your hard drive.<p>
* Click on one of the eight fields for non-image resources at the top and
choose the installation location from the dialog window.<p>
* Click <tt>Choose</tt>, select the image folders you wish to copy, then choose
the locations from the dialog window. Do not remove individual images from the
folders.<p>
* When you have finished relocating resources, click <tt>Set up Gateway</tt>.<p>
* Click <tt>Reset</tt> to return the settings to the cds.<p>
* Do not name any of the partitions <tt>Perseus Disk 1</tt>, etc. This is
because of software limitations.<p>
To start up Perseus 2.0, do the following:<p>
* Open the folder you have designated for Perseus. <p>
* Open the folder <tt>Local Stacks</tt>.<p>
* Double-click the stack <tt>Perseus Player</tt>. <p>
THIS PROCEDURE IS NEW FOR PERSEUS 2.0. DO NOT START UP BY DOUBLE-CLICKING THE
PERSEUS GATEWAY.<p>
After an interval, the Gateway and Navigator Palette will appear (figure
2.3).<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/2.3.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 2.3 Perseus Gateway with Navigator Palette, lower left.</b></CENTER><p>
<b></b>While working in Perseus, you only need to single-click the mouse.<p>
Perseus 2.0 is now ready to use. The Navigator Palette may be dragged out of
the way. Please remember that you can always return to the Gateway by clicking
the Gateway (temple) icon on the Navigator Palette.<p>
To quit Perseus, choose the item <tt>Quit</tt> from the File menu, or press the
keys <tt>command-q.</tt><p>
Here are two tasks you may want to complete before exploring Perseus 2.0.<p>
&gt; Duplicate the Paths, Notebook and CD Swapper stacks and personalize them
by renaming them, for example, "Elli's Paths" and "Elli's Notebook."<p>
By renaming these stacks, you can distinguish your Paths and Notebooks from
those of other users. When you start Perseus, you will need to identify the
location of these stacks through the Settings option, available from the
Gateway. More information on Settings is in <A HREF="#2.4">section 2.4</A>, detailed descriptions
of Path, Notebook and CD Swapper procedures may be found in <A HREF="ch10.html">chapter 10</A>, Saving
your Work.<p>
&gt; Make an alias of the Perseus Player and keep it in a convenient place in
your computer.<p>
For more detailed instructions on installation of hardware and startup, read

 DETAILED INSTALLATION AND STARTUP
</a></h3>
<h4>
<a name="2.4.1">2.4.1
HARDWARE INSTALLATION
</a></h4>
&gt; Connect the CD-ROM drive to the Macintosh. <p>
If your CD-ROM drive is external, it will be attached to the computer with a
SCSI cable. A number of hardware devices (hard disk drives, scanners, etc.) may
be linked together in a SCSI cable chain. One of the ports of the device at the
end of the chain must have a terminator plugged into it. The CD-ROM drive
documentation should describe proper cabling. In some cases, the terminator
must be plugged into the same port as the cable, in others into the  top or
bottom port. If you have difficulties, consult your hardware documentation and
try altering the configuration.<p>
&gt; Install the proper CD-ROM software drivers on your Macintosh system.<p>
Your CD-ROM drive documentation should explain how to install this software. <p>
CD-ROM drivers are not universal. If an Apple CD-ROM machine has been replaced
with one built by another manufacturer, it will be necessary to install the
proper driver software.<p>
&gt; Connect the videodisc player to the video monitor (if the videodisc is
used). <p>
If you are using a video monitor, this equipment is connected through
audiovisual RCA cables. Other cable configurations are required for monitors
without RCA input jacks.<p>
When you put the videodisc into the player, you should see the color test bars
on the monitor screen. If the player has front-panel controls, you should be
able to check the connection by stepping through some images on the
videodisc.<p>
&gt; Connect the videodisc player to the Macintosh (if the videodisc is used).
<p>
Use the correct cable to connect the communications port of the videodisc
player to the appropriate port on the Macintosh. The appropriate cable is often
provided with the videodisc player; if it is not, consult your local dealer.
Check the baud rate setting on the videodisc player. The correct setting for
computer interface should be specified in your videodisc player documentation.

STARTUP PROCEDURE
</a></h4>
After setting up the hardware and installing the software, you are ready to
start up Perseus. If you encounter any hardware or software problems, see
<A HREF="#2.6">Section 2.6</A>, Troubleshooting. <p>
NOTE: If you will be swapping CD-ROMs, please be sure to turn off File Sharing
in the Control Panels of your Macintosh. Otherwise the Mac will not eject the
cd.<p>
&gt; Double-click the Perseus Player icon in the Perseus/Local Stacks folders
you installed on your hard drive. <p>
Never double-click the Perseus Gateway if you are starting up from the Perseus
Player. Do not start up by clicking on another stack, or else Perseus will not
operate properly. If you encounter problems, start up using the System 7
procedure of dropping the the Gateway onto the HyperCard application.<p>
As Perseus initializes, the cursor changes to a watch, the Home card flashes on
the screen, and the Perseus Gateway  appears on your screen along with a small
floating window, the Navigator Palette. Once the cursor becomes the hand or the
arrow, Perseus is ready for use. You can move the Navigator Palette out of the
way by holding the mouse down on its title bar and dragging it to a convenient
part of the screen.<p>
The Navigator Palette contains eight buttons which issue commands to help you
make your way around the Pereus environment. Because the Navigator Palette is a
floating window, it remains on screen and active although another window may
also be active. <p>
If the Navigator Palette disappears, you can select <tt>Navigator</tt> from the
Perseus menu to reactivate it.<p>
In addition to the menu bar items that normally appear in HyperCard (File,
Edit, Go, Tools, Font and Style), two new items appear in the menu bar, Links
and Perseus. The resources and databases contained in Perseus are accessed both
through the Gateway icons and through the Links menus.<p>
You can always return to the Gateway by clicking the Gateway (temple) icon on
the Navigator Palette.<p>
To quit Perseus, release the mouse on the item Quit under the File menu, or
press command-q.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC30">Videodisc
instructions
</a></h5>
With the videodisc hardware installed and switched on, and Perseus 2.0 running,
click the Settings button on the lower left of the Gateway, and when the
settings card appears (figure 2.4), perform these steps:<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/2.4.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 2.4 Settings Card.</b></CENTER><p>
<b></b>	* Select a player type by releasing the mouse on the item under 	the
pop-up menu corresponding to your model of videodisc 	player.<p>
	* Click the button Use Video Images, to the right.<p>
	* Return to the Gateway by clicking the Gateway (temple) icon 	on the
Navigator Palette. <p>
A general overview of Settings may be found in <A HREF="ch4.html#4.2.2">chapter 4.2.2</A>. For detailed
instructions on Settings, please see <A HREF="ch10.html#10.5">chapter 10.5</A>.<p>
NOTE: We can recommend only the videodisc players listed in <A HREF="ch4.html#4.2.2">chapter 4.2.2</A> and
on the Settings card. Other models may not be compatible with Perseus. <p>
To learn the basics of Perseus, please turn to the <A HREF="ch3.html">next chapter</A>, where a number
of illustrative exercises in all facets of the database are given.<p>

 USING HYPERCARD(TM)
</a></h3>
This section is meant for users who are not familiar with HyperCard(TM), or who
are having problems related to the use of HyperCard and the Home stack. <p>
The Perseus database is built upon HyperCard, a Macintosh application that
stores and accesses data through an interface analogous to a "stack" of note
cards. HyperCard launches itself from the "Home" stack each time the
application is opened. You need to know almost nothing further about HyperCard
to use the Perseus program, but you might need to learn a few things to set up
your configuration. 
<h4>
<a name="2.5.1">2.5.1
 HYPERCARD ISSUES THAT AFFECT PERSEUS 
</a></h4>
To use Perseus 2.0, it is no longer necessary to have the HyperCard application
installed on your computer, because Pereus 2.0 is distributed with a fully
compiled, standalone Home stack called Perseus Player. Thus conflicts
encountered between HyperCard and Perseus 1.0 have been eliminated.<p>
Perseus Player should remain permanently in the Local Stacks folder on the hard
disk. The Player stack does many things, but one of them is especially
important for Perseus: establishing the search paths. The search paths make it
possible for Perseus to locate specific pieces of information from the large
universe of data, and they provide a prioritized structure for data searches.
Thus, for example, search paths in the Perseus Player stack tell HyperCard
where to find the image folders that contain the digitized photographs. <p>
Do not place a HyperCard Home stack or stacks from Perseus 1.0 inside the
Perseus Local Stacks folder. This will impair or prevent the successful use of
Perseus, because Perseus may begin to use inappropriate search paths from the
other Home stack.<p>
The default memory partition of Perseus Player has been set at the minimum
amount of memory required to use Perseus. If you have not already done so, go
to the Finder, select Perseus Player (but don't double-click), then choose  Get
Info from the File menu. Check the memory partition of Perseus Player in the
Get Info box and if necessary update it to at least 5 MB, if that much is
available.
<h4>
<a name="2.5.2">2.5.2
 INCOMPATIBILITY OF HYPERCARD WITH OTHER APPLICATIONS 
</a></h4>
You may have HyperCard installed on your hard disk in order to run other
applications or to write Perseus extensions. Problems encountered by beta
testers of version 2.0 with the Audio Help stack have been resolved by the
standalone Perseus Player software.
<h4>
<a name="2.5.3">2.5.3
 HYPERCARD SEARCH PATHS (FOR SYSTEM ADMINISTRATORS)
</a></h4>
If you change the configuration of the system running Perseus 2.0, such as
relocating some image folders on a hard disk, you must change the search paths
manually by opening the Perseus Player stack in the folder Local Stacks.
Similarly, if you change the configuration of your computer, such as renaming
the hard disk drive or placing Perseus within another folder, you must also
change the search paths because they specify device and folder names. <p>
Open the Perseus Player stack by double-clicking it. The stack
contains 6 cards. You can go forward in the stack by clicking on the arrow in
the lower right corner and backward by clicking on the arrow in the lower left.
Click forward to the fifth card of the stack to see the search paths for
documents (a button called "Documents" on this card will be highlighted). <p>
You will see a long list of Perseus image folder names listed
in the document search paths. If you have changed your configuration, change
the pertinent part of the search path here. Note that each line in the list of
search paths ends with a colon. An example of this procedure is as follows,
assuming that the Atlas and two image folders previously have been copied to a
folder named Perseus 2.0 on a hard disk named Elli's Hard Disk:<p>
Default search paths for documents:<p>
Perseus Disk 1:Atlas:<p>
Perseus Disk 2:1987.01.1s:<p>
Perseus Disk 2:1987.01.1t:<p>
<p>
Renamed search paths for documents:<p>
Elli's Hard Disk:Perseus 2.0:Atlas:<p>
Elli's Hard Disk:Perseus 2.0:1987.01.1s:<p>
Elli's Hard Disk:Perseus 2.0:1987.01.1t:<p>
The original search paths for documents can always be restored by repeating the
installation proceedure.

2.3. Troubleshooting </b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>If you encounter problems as you set up Perseus, follow the
recommendations below.
<h4>
<a name="2.6.2">2.6.2
CHECK THE MEMORY PARTITION OF PERSEUS PLAYER OR HYPERCARD
</a></h4>
System 7 requires 3-3.5 MB of your computer's RAM to run. The remaining RAM is
available for applications. Perseus needs at least 5 MB of memory to run
properly. You must set the "application memory size" of Perseus Player to at
least 5000. If you have more than 8 MB of RAM on your Macintosh, Perseus will
perform even better if you allot increased memory to Perseus Player. Even if
your computer has 20 MB of memory, Perseus Player will not capitalize on the
excess memory until you set the application memory size to a higher setting.
More memory allotted to Perseus Player means that more Perseus stacks and
images can be opened simultaneously, and they will work more quickly.<p>
In the Perseus 2.0 folder, click the Perseus Player icon once while the
application is not in use and choose Get Info from the File Menu. The lower
right-hand corner of the dialog box contains a number that reflects the current
memory setting. Type "5000" into the box, or type a larger number if your
computer has sufficient available RAM, as described above.
<h4>
<a name="2.6.3">2.6.3
HARDWARE
</a></h4>
If something is wrong with the CD-ROM drive, it may just spin, and the little
red light either will stay lit and not flash or will flash constantly at
regular intervals. If this continues for more than two minutes, press the
button on the front of the CD-ROM drive, hold it for a few seconds, and then
release. The disk should eject. Check all connections and software
installations. Check SCSI terminators, and check that you have the correct
CD-ROM drivers. <p>
If the Perseus Disk 1 icon does not appear on your desk top, try restarting all
hardware, taking care to turn on the CD-ROM drive <i>without</i> the disk in
it, then turn on the computer and when it is finished booting up, insert
Perseus Disk 1 into the CD-ROM drive. If the icon still does not appear, try
switching places of the SCSI connector and the terminator in the CD-ROM ports.
Finally, check the Extensions folder in your System folder to make sure that
the Apple CD-ROM extension is there for an Apple CD-ROM player, or that the
appropriate extension is there for another manufacturer's CD-ROM player.<p>
If you are using a videodisc player and cannot display images from the
videodisc, check the cable connections and confirm that you are using the
appropriate cable. Check the baud rate setting on your videodisc player
(specified in the player documentation).
<h4>
<a name="2.6.4">2.6.4
SOFTWARE
</a></h4>
If extensions to Perseus are being used, check whether the hard disk contains
other versions of HyperCard earlier than 2.1; check whether other Home stacks
and Perseus 1.0 stacks are in the Perseus 2.0 folder. <p>
A related problem may be the existence of multiple copies of the Perseus Player
stack. The Perseus Player is very important in using Perseus, because the
Perseus Player stack specifies the location of files and instructs HyperCard
where on your hard drive to look for Perseus data. Double-click the Perseus
Player icon from the Macintosh desktop and move forward in this stack (by
clicking the lower right hand arrow) until you see the list of search paths for
stacks, applications, and documents. Check that the search paths are specified
correctly in relation to your software configuration.<p>
If you see the error message "Cannot open MDB Index," check the path names in
the correct version of the Perseus Player documents card.<p>
If you are unable to type accented Greek, check that SMK GreekKeys 7.0 has been
installed in your system.  The Greek fonts Symbol and Super Greek are
incompatible with GreekKeys and Perseus 2.0.<p><p>
