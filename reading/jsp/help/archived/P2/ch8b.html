PHILOLOGICAL TOOLS
</a></h3>
Eight Philological Tools are available to explore the vocabulary, grammar,
syntax, usage, and word frequencies in ancient Greek. They are: <p>
* Morphological Analysis<br>
* Greek-English Lexicon<br>
* Greek Word Search<br>
* Greek Words in Proximity<br>
* English-Greek Word Search<br>
* Greek Dictionary Entry Search<br>
* Greek Word Frequencies -- Overview<br>
* Greek Word Frequencies -- By Author

KEY TERMS: WORDS, STRINGS, FORMS AND DICTIONARY ENTRIES
</a></h4>
The Philological Tools provide support for quite powerful and sophisticated
analysis of the source in Perseus. Before using these tools, it is important to
distinguish between several different kinds of "word." <p>
This paragraph contains 123 words. If you read through it from start to finish,
counting each word as you read it, you would end up with a total of 123. In
some contexts, however, we might mean that the entire paragraph contains only
74 "unique" words: i.e., the English word "the" would count only once, no
matter how often it showed up in the text. Again, we must take account of
grammatically inflected forms. Do "went," "gone" and "going" all count as
unique words or only as forms of the verb "to go"? In Perseus, word-count
frequencies are a total of all words in the text, repeated and inflected. Words
in the lexical tools are reached via the form given  in their dictionary entry
headings, rather than their inflected forms. <p>
The following  definitions will be useful:<p>
<b>Strings:</b> Any collection of letters strung together is a "string." A
string can be a full word (e.g., "philological") or a word fragment ("philol-",
"-ologic-", "-ical") or both ("logic" is both a word in its own right and a
<u>sub</u>string of "philological"). Virtually all of the tools developed for
searching Greek texts (and many of those for English as well) search not for
words, but for strings embedded in words. Thus "go" will retrieve "goes" and
"gone" but not "went," and there is no convenient way to locate all forms of an
irregular word (e.g., "is", "was", "be" etc.). While this problem may be a
nuisance in English (which retains relatively few endings), in a highly
inflected language such as classical Greek, string based searching can be
especially frustrating. The remedy for this is Perseus's Morphological
database, which has the ability to trace the irregular forms to their
dictionary entry.<p>
<b>Inflected Forms</b> <b>and</b> <b>Dictionary Entries</b>: The forms "goes",
"going" and "gone" are all inflected forms that belong to the same word, "go."
The philological tools distinguish sharply between inflected forms and their
dictionary entries. One of the major achievements of the Perseus database is
that it allows users to deal not only with strings and inflected forms but with
dictionary entries as well: thus, you can perform the Greek equivalent of
asking for "go" and retrieve "goes", "gone", and "went."<p>
<b>A note on typing Greek:  </b>While cutting and pasting Greek text into a
field may serve in most cases as a workaround, you will find that the ability
to type correctly accented Greek is indispensible in making the most efficient
use of the Philological Tools. Perseus supports the SMK GreekKeys font, which
must be installed in your system. Information on ordering GreekKeys may be
found in <A HREF="ch2.html#2.1.2">section 2.1.2</A>. The Greek characters generally correspond to the Roman
ones, with <IMG src="/img/help/letters.gif">. The accents live "under" the numbers
and are typed in combination with the Option key before the vowel is typed. The
Greek alphabet, its transliteration into Roman characters, and its GreekKeys
equivalents may be found in Online help under the Stack Topic, The Greek
Alphabet.

<a name="8.4.2">8.4.2
DESCRIPTION AND LIMITATIONS OF THE PHILOLOGICAL TOOLS
</a></h4>
Underlying the Philological Tools is a morphological database that was created
by parsing every Greek word in the Perseus Primary Texts and storing the
results. In it there are 3.4 million words, but only 260,000 unique strings --
in other words, each inflected form shows up on the average 13 times. Each of
these forms has been processed by the morphological analysis system developed
by the Perseus Project. Its tables of nominal and verbal stems are based upon
those in the Liddell-Scott <i>Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon</i>. While we
have added many words to our morphological database that are not in
Liddell-Scott, there are still some words in Perseus 2.0 for which we do not
have any morphological analysis. This will change in coming years as we extract
morphological information from the larger Greek Lexicon, the ninth edition of
Liddell-Scott-Jones. The table below shows the success rate for analyzing all
forms in Perseus.<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/8.1t.gif"><p>
<b>Table 8.1 Success rate for analyzing forms in Perseus.</b><p>
</CENTER><b></b>The database provides a foundation for the Philological Tools and allows
you to perform two strategic functions. First, you can analyze any word in a
text (except all but 31% of proper nouns), and second, you can investigate all
instances of a Greek word across the range of texts. Together, these two
strategies allow you to investigate Greek words in Perseus texts with greater
precision than has been possible heretofore, even with electronic tools.<p>
The Morphological Analysis tool can only recognize forms. It is not aware of
the syntax of a sentence. If a form has more than one possible analysis, the
only thing that the morphological analyzer can do is to list all applicable
parses. It is not able to identify the syntactically correct form. Therefore,
several of the Philological Tools display two sets of statistical results: one
that takes into account only unambiguous forms with one possible parse, and
another that includes all forms, ambiguous and unambiguous. Thus, faced with a
form such as <IMG src="/img/help/ais1.gif">, the Morphological Analysis tool simply
reports that this could be <u>either</u> the dative singular of the noun
<IMG src="/img/help/ais3.gif">, "shame," <u>or</u> one of several forms of the verb
<IMG src="/img/help/ais2.gif">, "to cause shame." The English equivalent is to recognize "fly"
as either a noun or a verb but to leave it to the user to sort out the
ambiguity between these two choices by using the context. (For more information
on this, see the discussion of the Morphological Analysis tool below.) It is
important to keep this in mind when working with the Philological Tools.<p>
All of the Philological Tools allow you to enter your own word or string, in
Greek or English (as appropriate). Although the Philological Tools allow the
user to enter a word or string, they are primarily used by selecting text
within another Perseus resource (Greek or English text depending on the tool to
be activated), then choosing the desired tool from the Links menu. If any text
is selected when a tool is activated, that tool will try to act on the selected
text. To type accented Greek text, you must have SMK GreekKeys 7.0 installed in
your system (information on where to buy GreekKeys is in<A HREF="ch2.html#2.1.2"> chapter 2.1.2</A>). You
must be precise in typing accents and diacritical marks for the morphological
tools to recognize the word (unless otherwise specified).
<h4>
<a name="8.4.3">8.4.3
CALCULATING FREQUENCIES
</a></h4>
Because the length of texts varies, a dictionary entry whose forms appear 100
times in Demosthenes and 30 times in Lysias is actually <u>more common</u> in
Lysias, because our corpus of Demosthenes is five times larger than that of
Lysias (c. 300,000 vs. 60,000 words). For this reason, Perseus reports,
wherever possible, not only the <u>instances</u> (i.e., the absolute frequency,
how many times a dictionary entry appears in a given author, or 100 for
Demosthenes and 30 for Lysias in the above example), but also the relative
frequency (<u>frequencies/10,000 words)</u>. In other words, we take into
consideration the differing sizes of the texts in Perseus 2.0 so that you can
compare the frequency of words more effectively. For each dictionary entry in
each text, we determine the rate at which it appears in for every 10,000 words
in a given text. Thus, in the above example, the frequencies/10,000 words would
be 3.33 for Demosthenes and 5 for Lysias.<p>
Some inflected forms are, however, "lexically ambiguous," i.e., they can come
from more than one dictionary entry (e.g., Greek <IMG src="/img/help/ais1.gif"> can
be an inflected form of either the noun <IMG src="/img/help/ais3.gif">, "shame," or of the verb
<IMG src="/img/help/ais2.gif">, "to cause shame"). Each frequency thus has both a maximum and a
minimum. The <u>maximum</u> "instances" and "freqs/10,000 words" assumes that
all possible inflected forms of a dictionary entry really do belong to that
entry (if you are searching for the verb <IMG src="/img/help/ais2.gif">, assume that
<IMG src="/img/help/ais1.gif"> is a verbal form). The <u>minimum</u> figure assumes
that none of the lexically ambiguous inflected forms belong to the dictionary
entry (if you are searching for the verb <IMG src="/img/help/ais2.gif">, assume that
<IMG src="/img/help/ais1.gif"> is not an inflected form of this verb). If the
maximum and minimum frequencies are the same, then all the possible forms of
the dictionary entry are lexically unambiguous. On the other hand, if the
maximum and minimum frequencies are different, then you will have to use your
judgment to determine the true frequency of the dictionary entry.

RELATED TOOLS BUTTON
</a></h4>
Since the eight philological tools are all in the Links menu, they are
available anywhere in Perseus. Some of these philological tools are, however,
particularly useful in different positions, and each of the eight philological
tools contains a Related Tools pop-up menu in the upper right hand corner of
the screen. The Related Tools menu lists other philological tools which are
particularly relevant to the tool that you are currently using.
<h4>
<a name="8.4.5">8.4.5
OVERVIEW OF THE PHILOLOGICAL TOOLS
</a></h4>
The Philological Tools are functionally linked to each other for maximum
flexibility.<p>
The eight Philological Tools are described below. They divide into four basic
groups:<p>
1) <b>Morphological Analysis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Greek-English Lexicon</b>: When
working with a text you can use the Morphological Analysis tool to find out the
grammatical function of a form and the Greek-English Lexicon to find out its
meaning.<p>
2) <b>Greek Word Search</b> <b>and</b> <b>Greek Words in Proximity</b>: These
tools allow you to locate passages in which one or more particular dictionary
entries appear.<p>
3) <b>English-Greek Word Search</b> <b>and</b> <b>Greek Dictionary Entry
Search</b>: These tools allow you to locate Greek words (or groups of Greek
words) for further study.<p>
4) <b>Greek Word Freqs -- Overview</b> <b>and</b> <b>Greek Word Freqs -- by
Author</b>:  These tools allow you to explore quantitative differences in usage
between different authors, genres and periods.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC11">Morphological
Analysis
</a></h5>
Enter an inflected Greek form to find out its possible morphological analyses
and what dictionary entries it might come from. <p>
Not only will beginning and intermediate students of the Greek language find
the morphological analysis helpful, but advanced students also will find this
tool indispensible in determining the precise dictionary entry for a form: your
can find out quickly whether LSJ list the words under <IMG src="/img/help/kata1.gif">  or
<IMG src="/img/help/kata2.gif">, <IMG src="/img/help/kata3.gif"> or <IMG src="/img/help/kata4.gif">, or <IMG src="/img/help/ro1.gif"> or
<IMG src="/img/help/ro2.gif">.<p>
Selecting English text or proper nouns will result in a message that no
analysis is offered for this word.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC12">Greek-English
Lexicon
</a></h5>
Enter a Greek word in its dictionary form to find its definitions. The Perseus
Greek-English Lexicon is based on the Liddell-Scott <i>Intermediate
Greek-English Lexicon</i>.<p>
You must provide the exact spelling to locate an entry. You can use the
Morphological Analysis tool or the Greek Dictionary Entry Search tool to help
locate the right spelling.<p>
Looking for an English word or an inflected Greek form in the Greek-English
Lexicon will result in a message that the selected text is not in the
dictionary.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC13">Greek
Word Search
</a></h5>
Enter a dictionary entry or a string to find the texts containing it in
Perseus. Greek Word Search gives the citations for each word and links you
directly with the passage. Thus, you can, for example, search for <IMG src="/img/help/fero.gif"> and
retrieve <IMG src="/img/help/oiso.gif"> and <IMG src="/img/help/hneg.gif">, or you can search for <IMG src="/img/help/pemp.gif"> and
retrieve <IMG src="/img/help/pemp2.gif">, <IMG src="/img/help/pemp3.gif">, <IMG src="/img/help/pemp4.gif">, etc. <p>
Searching for English text will result in a message that the lemma is not used
in the selected author's works. 
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC14">Greek
Words in Proximity
</a></h5>
With this tool, you can make two lists of dictionary entries and identify all
passages in which any possible form from list 1 appears within a given number
of words of any possible form from list 2.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC15">English-Greek
Word Search
</a></h5>
 This tool allows you to search for words within a semantic category. For
example, suppose you are interested in Greek words for "money" or "ship" or
"statue." You can use this tool to locate probable equivalents and convert the
Liddell-Scott <i>Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon</i> into a rough, but
powerful, English-Greek lexicon.<p>
The English-Greek Word Search searches in the Greek lexicon for words whose
definition contains the selected word. Any italicized text in a dictionary
entry from the Liddell-Scott <i>Intermediate Greek-English</i> <i>Lexicon</i>
is treated as a definition, and in using this tool you are, in effect,
consulting an index of English words from this lexicon.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC16">Greek
Dictionary Entry Search
</a></h5>
You can use the Greek Dictionary Entry Search to locate individual dictionary
entries or groups of dictionary entries. Use the Greek Dictionary Entry Search
to find out precisely how a Greek dictionary entry is spelled (<IMG src="/img/help/ss.gif"> or <IMG src="/img/help/tt.gif">,
<IMG src="/img/help/ia.gif"> or <IMG src="/img/help/ih.gif">, for example). Again, you can locate all dictionary entries that
contain a certain string: those ending in <IMG src="/img/help/frwn.gif"> or <IMG src="/img/help/sis.gif">, or that contain the
string <IMG src="/img/help/olb.gif"> (e.g., <IMG src="/img/help/ano.gif"> or <IMG src="/img/help/euol.gif"> ), or <IMG src="/img/help/pemp.gif"> (e.g., <IMG src="/img/help/ant.gif">, <IMG src="/img/help/diapem.gif">, <IMG src="/img/help/duspemp.gif">). Finally, if you
want to do a Greek Word Search, but lack a convenient way of typing accents
because you do not have SMK GreekKeys installed, you can obtain the form with
the Greek Dictionary Entry Search.<p>
You can go from the Greek Dictionary Entry Search tool to any of the other
Philological Tools. 
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC17">Greek
Word Frequencies -- Overview
</a></h5>
The Greek Word Frequencies tool displays the statistical frequencies with which
a particular Greek word is used among all the Greek authors in Perseus.  This
tool will provide you with the totals for a list of words, often with
interesting results: A search in the Greek Word Frequencies -- Overview for
<IMG src="/img/help/ail.gif">, "cat" produces 7 instances for all of Greek within
Perseus. Perhaps not unsurpringly, six fall in Herodotus 2, a book devoted to
Egypt. The seventh is in Aristophanes; in what context will
<IMG src="/img/help/ail.gif"> appear?
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC18">Greek
Word Frequencies -- by Author
</a></h5>
The Greek-Word Frequencies -- by Author tool allows you to compose a list of
words and then see which and how often these words occur in a particular
author. Because Perseus keeps the word list in its memory, the query can be
repeated for each author in the database. 
<h4>
<a name="8.4.6">8.4.6
MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS TOOL
</a></h4>
The Morphological Analysis tool parses Greek word forms, showing the dictionary
form (lemma) and related analysis. The Morphological Analysis tool is available
directly from Primary Text displays through the Analyze button, from the Links
menu, and from the Gateway via the Tools &amp; References icon. <p>
This tool retrieves a morphological analysis, not a syntactic analysis, of the
Greek word. If the form you are analyzing could be formed from more than one
word, the Morphological Analysis tool will display all possible lemmas and
analyses. It does not indicate which one is correct for the particular form you
selected.<p>
If you have chosen Morphological Analysis from the Tools &amp; References Index
or the Links menu, you must enter a word to analyze. If you are in a Primary
Text and want to analyze a word, highlight it and click the Analyze button. The
tool will automatically parse that word. <p>
The examples used below will trace through the analysis of words selected from
a Primary Text and from Philological Tools.<p>
&gt;	Analyze forms from Pindar's <i>First Olympian Ode.</i><p>
Go to Pindar First Olympian in the Primary Texts by releasing the mouse on the
item  Lookup under the Links menu. Type <tt>Pind. O. 1.1</tt> into the box and
press Return.<p>
Highlight the Greek word <IMG src="/img/help/garu.gif">.<p>
Click the button <tt>Analyze</tt>, upper right. The Morphological Analysis card
appears with the form <IMG src="/img/help/garu.gif"> above, the lemma (dictionary form) in
boldface type in the middle, and the grammatical analysis below (figure
8.12).<p>
        
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/8.12.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 8.12 Morphological Analysis showing Related Tools pop-up menu.</b><p>
</CENTER><b></b>Explanation of the parse abbreviation "pres inf act epic doric" is given
in Online help for Morphological Analysis.<p>
To find the meaning of <IMG src="/img/help/ghru.gif">, highlight it. Then choose <tt>Greek-English
Lexicon </tt>from the pop-up menu Related Tools. You may highlight the lemma
and go to the other Philological Tools under the Related Tools pop-up menu,
described below. These include Greek Word Search, Greek Word Frequencies --
Overview and Greek Word Frequencies -- By Author. <p>
To return to the text of Pindar, click the Go Back arrow on the Navigator
Palette. <p>
&gt;	Analyze a form directly from the Morphological Analysis card.<p>
Type <IMG src="/img/help/boa.gif"> into the Form field, and click Analyze to parse the word
(figure 8.13).<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/8.13.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 8.13 Morphological Analysis tool.</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>To type Greek text, you must have SMK GreekKeys installed in your
system. You must be precise in typing accents and diacritical marks using SMK
GreekKeys.<p>
Here the word analysis results in three lemmas. 
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC20">Related
Tools
</a></h5>
The Related Tools button in the upper right hand corner relates the
Morphological Analysis tool to other Philological Tools. If you select text
from the morphological analysis before choosing another tool, the new tool will
apply itself to the selection. Figure 8.13 illustrates the choices available
here.<p>
The four related tools are those which work with one or more dictionary
entries. In the example above using <IMG src="/img/help/boa.gif">, if you select one of the three
lemmas (dictionary entries) and then call up one of these four related tools,
Perseus will automatically paste the selected dictionary entry into the
selected tool. <p>
If you do not select anything and call up the Greek-English Lexicon or the
Greek Word Search tools, nothing will be pasted into them. <p>
On the other hand, Greek Word Frequency tools will look up all lemmas listed if
you do not select one of the lemmas, in this case, all three.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC21">Limitations</a></h5>
1) 	The Morphological Analysis Tool is not context sensitive. <p>
* It makes no attempt to determine whether a form such as
<IMG src="/img/help/ais1.gif"> is a substantive or a verb.<p>
* If it sees a form such as <IMG src="/img/help/pemp5.gif">, it recognizes this as a possible
present indicative or imperative, but it also reports that this could be an
unaugmented Epic or Ionic. Even if you are reading an Attic author such as
Demosthenes, it still reports the possible Epic and Ionic interpretation
because you may, for example, be looking at a form from a piece of quoted
poetry.<p>
2)	The Morphological Analysis Tool seeks every possible morphological analysis
for every form that it examines. With 30,000 stems, 10,000 inflections and
rules for coping with several Greek dialects, some of the morphological
analyses can be surprising.<p>
3	The Mophological Analysis Tool does not systematically cover proper names.
Its can recognize 22,000 of the 32,000 proper names in Perseus 2.0, a success
rate of 69%.<p>
Our morphological database is based on the morphological information from the
Liddell-Scott <i>Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon</i>, a reference tool which
covers only a small number of proper names. While we have added morphological
information for over 10,000 additional words, we continue to systematically add
proper names.<p>
4)	The Morphological Analysis tool has been taught to recognize many words that
are not in the <i>Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon</i>, but it still is not
complete. It can recognize 223,000 out of the 228,000 unique strings in Perseus
2.0, a success rate of 98%.<p>

<a name="8.4.7">8.4.7
GREEK-ENGLISH LEXICON
</a></h4>
The Greek-English Lexicon contains the Greek and English definitions from the
Liddell-Scott <i>Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon</i>. The Greek-English
Lexicon is entered from the Links menu, from the Gateway via the Tools &amp;
References icon, and from the Related Tools pop-up menu in the various
Philological Tools.<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/8.14.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 8.14 Greek-English Lexicon.</b><p>
</CENTER><b></b>&gt;	Look up the meaning of <IMG src="/img/help/aud1.gif"> in Pindar's First
Olympian.<p>
Go to Pindar First Olympian in the Primary Texts by choosing <tt>Lookup</tt>
from the Links menu. Type <tt>Pind. O. 1.1</tt> into the box and press
Return.<p>
Highlight the Greek word <IMG src="/img/help/aud2.gif"> in line 7. Click
<tt>Analyze</tt>. On the Morphological Analysis card, highlight the lemma
<IMG src="/img/help/aud1.gif">, then choose <tt>Greek-English Lexicon</tt> from the
Related Tools pop-up menu.<p>
Alternatively you can look up lemmas by typing them directly into the Entry
field if you have SMK GreekKeys 7.0 installed in your system. Click the "Entry"
field to make the insertion point appear. Then click <tt>Look Up</tt> to see a
definition of the word. You can paste in a Greek word (in its dictionary form).
<p>
The Greek-English Lexicon displays the entry for a word as it appears in the
Liddell-Scott <i>Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon</i> (figure 8.11). The
first field lists the definitions. <p>
The buttons <tt>See Previous Entry</tt> and <tt>See Following Entry</tt> move
backward and forward in the Lexicon.<p>
The "Derived From" field lists explicit cross-references between dictionary
entries. In practice, any word or brief phrase enclosed in parentheses at the
beginning of a dictionary article in the lexicon will be placed in the Derived
From entry. Thus in the following entry:<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/8.14b.gif"></CENTER>
(<IMG src="/img/help/aud3.gif">) appears in Perseus thus (figure 8.15):<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/8.15.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 8.15 <tt>Derived from:</tt> field.</b><p>
</CENTER><b></b>Note that the Greek-English lexicon does not always include derivations
in this parenthetical information. Consider, for example, the following entry
in the print dictionary:<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/8.15b.gif"></CENTER>
This entry defines a homonymous relationship, i.e., the verb <IMG src="/img/help/kun2.gif"> has
the same meaning as <IMG src="/img/help/kun.gif">. In Perseus, the "=<IMG src="/img/help/kun.gif">"
reference also appears in the Derived From field.<p>
The other three fields on this card include information derived from, but not
explicit in, the print version of the lexicon. These fields provide machine
generated indexes to help you make connections between words.<p>
The Source For field lists words produced by the Entry word. In the example
above, <IMG src="/img/help/aud1.gif"> is given as derived from <IMG src="/img/help/aud3.gif">. If you
call up the entry for <IMG src="/img/help/aud3.gif">, you will find <IMG src="/img/help/aud1.gif"> in
the Source For field, along with <IMG src="/img/help/aud4.gif">, <<IMG src="/img/help/aud5.gif"> and
<IMG src="/img/help/aud6.gif">, other words produced by <IMG src="/img/help/aud1.gif"> (figure
8.16).<p>
 
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/8.16.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 8.16 <tt>Source for: </tt>field.</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>The field bottom left lists other possible forms of this dictionary

the other possible forms are<IMG src="/img/help/aud7.gif">, <IMG src="/img/help/aud3.gif"> and
<IMG src="/img/help/aud8.gif"> (figure 8.14). Click <IMG src="/img/help/aud7.gif"> and the forms
<IMG src="/img/help/aud9.gif"> and <IMG src="/img/help/prosf.gif"> are displayed in the field <tt>Appears In</tt> lower

<a name="RTFToC9">Limitations</a></h5>
1)	A search for a word in <i>all  </i>Perseus authors (global search) would
often produce results far beyond the capabilities of HyperCard. Until the
software is developed, we suggest that you use the Greek Word Frequencies --
Overview feature to see in what authors a word shows up, then use Greek Word
Search, proceding author by author.<p>
2)	Some of the most common words in Greek are not indexed:<p>
Neither Greek Word Search (nor the Greek Words in Proximity Search) search
Greek texts directly. Instead, they rely upon indexes of the Perseus texts. To
limit the size of the indexes, some of the most common words have not been
included (see the table below). If you wish to study these words, you must use
Pandora or some other search tool for the <i>Thesaurus Linguae Graecae.</i>

You can also work directly with the entire list of dictionary entries that you
have generated. By going to either of the two Greek Word Frequency tools, you
can see how often all of "household" words appear in different authors. You
could thus begin to see whether this concept seems to be more or less common in
different authors. (Words associated with "household" show up with twice the
frequency in Aeschylus that they do in Sophocles, and 2 1/3 times as often in
Euripides as they do in Sophocles.)<p>
If you use the Related Tools to call up the Greek Words in Proximity Search,
you can add the entire list of dictionary entries for "household" to one of the
two lists (see the example in <A HREF="#8.4.9">section 8.4.9</A> above). You could thus use the

The Greek Dictionary Entry Search is linked with the other Philological Tools
via the pop-up menu, upper right. If you select text from the list of
dictionary Entries before choosing another tool, the new tool will apply itself
to the selection. Thus you can copy over the dictionary form of a Greek word to
the following tools: Greek Word Search, Greek English Lexicon, Greek Word
Frequencies (Overview and By Author) and Greek Words in Proximity.<p>
<h4><a name="8.4.12">8.4.12 GREEK WORD FREQUENCIES
</a></h4>
The Greek Word Frequencies -- Overview tool displays the frequencies with which
a particular Greek word, or a list of words, is used among all the authors of
Primary Texts. The Greek Word Frequencies -- By Author tool displays the
frequencies with which a particular Greek word, or a list of words, is used in
one Primary Text author. Both tools are accessed from the Links menu, from the
Tools &amp; Resources icon in the Gateway, and from the Related Tools pop-up
menu on the other Philological Tools. If you have opened this tool from another
philological tool, the current list of Greek words is placed in a scrolling
field at the left. Each Greek Word Frequencies tool applies itself to the first
word in the list, which appears in the field at the top.

of the word (Maximum) and all definite uses of the word (Minimum). Instances
are the number of times the word is used throughout the author's work.
Frequency is the number of instances a word is used per 10,000 words.
