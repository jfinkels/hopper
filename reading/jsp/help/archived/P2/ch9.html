Tools to search the Perseus database include the Browser and English Index
(described in <A HREF="ch5.html">chapter 5</A>) and Philological Tools for working with the Greek
language (described in <A HREF="ch8b.html">chapter 8, part 2</A>). References include the Encyclopedia  and
Bibliography. These are the utilities and secondary resources that Perseus
provides to find and analyze information.

</a></h3>
The Tools &amp; References Index (figure 9.1) displays the names of tools and
references in Perseus and provides access to them. As with other Perseus
indexes, the main categories are shown in boldface, with subcategories shown
beneath each main category. You must click a subcategory to go to that tool or
reference. <p>

 ENCYCLOPEDIA
</a></h3>
The Encyclopedia is composed of short articles and glosses on classical
civilization, art, and architecture based on several sources. Some articles
have accompanying views or illustrations. Approximately three hundred articles
were written expressly for the Perseus Project. These articles focus on regions
of Greece, biographies of ancient authors, terminology for art and
architecture, and descriptions of musical instruments. These articles may be
accessed also from the Essays and Catalogs icon on the Gateway.  <p>
The rest of the entries (approximately 3,500) are derived from the indexes to
the Loeb Classical Library editions of Herodotus and Apollodorus and the Frazer
edition of  Pausanias, and are so marked. These were deemed useful primarily
because they contain explanatory glosses of the encyclopedia entry. In
addition, it is possible to use the references to Herodotus, Apollodorus, and
Pausanias to go directly into the text. <p>
Users should keep in mind, however, that gloss-type entries are restricted to
these three authors, and may not include other citations that are in Perseus.
To find other citations, use the English Word Search or the Lookup tool.  <p>
From the Gateway, go to the Encyclopedia by clicking the Tools &amp; References
icon, then either <tt>Alphebetical Index</tt> or <tt>Subject Index</tt> under
the topic Encyclopedia. Or from anywhere within Perseus, choose the item
<tt>Encyclopedia</tt> from the Links menu, from which the Alphebetical Index is
the default point of entry. The Subject Index lists only the articles written
for Perseus and not the entries derived from the Loeb indexes (figure 9.2). The
Alphabetical Index lists both types of Encyclopedia entries (figure 9.3).

ENCYCLOPEDIA ARTICLE
</a></h4>
Each article in the Encyclopedia consists of the text of the article, a
bibliography of primary sources, and a list of related topics in the
Encyclopedia. A typical article is depicted below (figure 9.4).<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/9.4.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 9.4  Encyclopedia article.</b><p>
</CENTER><b></b>The Tools &amp; References icon is at the top left of the article,
followed by the name of the entry. On the top right is the <tt>Index</tt>
button. The text of the article appears in a scrolling text field. Literary
Sources are listed in this field. References to texts in Perseus are underlined
and shown in their abbreviated canonical syntax. <p>
Below the text of the article are two fields: <tt>Views</tt> and <tt>See
Also</tt>. <tt>Views</tt> is a list of any illustrations and photographs
related to the topic of the article. <tt>See Also</tt> lists any
cross-references to related articles in the Encyclopedia.

Literary sources for the encyclopedia article, if applicable, are shown at the
end of the article.<p>
Select text from this field and release the mouse on the item Primary Texts
under the Links menu to go directly to this reference.<p>
To return to the encyclopedia article, click the Go Back arrow on the Navigator
Palette.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC9">Views</a></h5>
Click a line in the list of views to see an illustration or photograph.<p>
If no views are available, this area will be empty.<p>
Two types of views are available - illustrations and photographs. Both types
appear in an additional window. When a view is displayed, drawing or
photography credits also appear in a small floating window that can be closed
or repositioned on the screen. <p>
NOTE:  The illustrations and photographs are not stored in HyperCard and
therefore should be treated differently from other Perseus elements. In
particular, you must click the close box to remove an illustration. If the
window is not active, click the title bar. If you use the Navigator while an
illustration window is open, Perseus will respond, but you will be unable to
see the response if the image window is covering the active HyperCard window.

<h3><a name="9.3">9.3 BIBLIOGRAPHY
</a></h3>
The Perseus Bibliography is divided into two sections, Sources Used and Further
Information. Sources Used contains citations from secondary works used to
compile the Perseus database. Further Information lists sources of information
external to Perseus that is pertinent to the study of Ancient Greek language,
culture and art. 
<h4>
<a name="9.3.1">9.3.1
SOURCES USED
</a></h4>
The Sources Used resource has more than 2,500 entries of materials used in the
development of Perseus. Its primary use is as an interactive bibliography that
you can call upon whenever you see a source attribution in narrative, catalog
descriptions, or notes. <p>
To access the Sources Used Index (figure 9.5) from the Gateway, click the Tools
&amp; Resources icon, then click <tt>Sources Used</tt> under the topic
Bibliography. Or from anywhere within Perseus, choose the item <tt>Sources
Used</tt> from the Links menu.<p>
      
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/9.5.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 9.5 Sources Used index</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>The three buttons on the bottom take you to short entry headings in the
letters A through F, G through O and P through Z. Click an item in the Souorces
Used Index to go to the full entry. Figure 9.6 shows the full entry for the
item Aalders 1982.<p>

<b></b>Click the button <tt>Index</tt>, upper right, to return to the Sources
Used Index.<p>
&gt;	Make a link with Sources Used from a Perseus citation.<p>
The Pottery Descriptions in the Art &amp; Archaeology resource show the various
sources used to compile the information. To follow this example of Sources
Used, use the Lookup tool to go directly to the vase Boston 98.894 . <p>
Choose <tt>Lookup</tt> from the Links menu, type <tt>Boston 98.894</tt> in the
floating window, then press Return. Now click <tt>in Vase Catalog</tt> in the
right column of results. <p>
When you see the Catalog Summary card for this object, click the
<tt>Description</tt> button in the upper right. Scroll to the end of the
description.<p>
At the bottom of the description, select the first source attribution,
<u>Fairbanks 1928</u>. <p>
Note that the selection must be exact, e.g., no spaces before or after
<u>Fairbanks 1928</u>.<p>
Choose the item <tt>Sources Used</tt> from the Links menu. (Hold the shift key
down to open the Sources Used stack in a new window.)<p>
The Sources Used resource opens to the full citation for Fairbanks 1928. Use
the <tt>Index</tt> button to see an alphabetical list of citations. Although
you can page through the Sources Used information by clicking the forward and
backward arrows on the Navigator Palette, you will be unable to relate the
source to a specific Perseus item.

FURTHER SOURCES 
</a></h4>
Further Sources are further bibliographic references for the interested reader.
Despite the abundance of its texts, images and reference materials, Perseus
contains only a small part of the resources available to students of classical
Greece. Further Sources lists a number of books, some very old, others less so,
some of interest primarily to beginners, some to specialists. These books are
useful supplements to Perseus, and are profitably used in conjunction with it.
<p>
The list of further sources includes grammars and dictionaries, general
reference works, and specific references for history, literature, religion,
myth, atlas, culture, architecture, and art.<p>
To go to Further Sources, click the Tools &amp; References icon on the Gateway,
then click <tt>Further Sources</tt> under the topic Bibliography (figure
9.7).<p>
You cannot access Further Sources via the Links menu.<p>
