<p><CENTER><h2>CHAPTER
3: THE PERSEUS ENVIRONMENT, THE GUIDED TOURS, AND ONLINE HELP</h2></CENTER>
<HR>
The first section of this chapter is intended as a general, illustrated
introduction to the contents and geography of the Perseus environment. Some
users may want to start exploring Perseus right away, so <A HREF="#3.1">section 3.1</A> provides
quick-entry operating instructions with specific targets in the text, vase
collection, atlas and history portions of the Perseus database. These same
targets are included in Guided Tour 1 of Perseus, described below in <A HREF="#3.2">section
3.2</A>. Three additional Guided Tours are included with the intent to show off
both the new interface and the philological and archaeological features of
verson 2.0.<p>
Both newcomers and users familiar with Perseus 1.0 will want to take advantage
of the new Online help (<A HREF="#3.3">section 3.3</A>). A detailed discussion of Macintosh and
HyperCard techniques as they apply to Perseus will be found in <A HREF="ch4.html">chapter 4</A>,
Navigation, and <A HREF="ch5.html">chapter 5</A>, Searching.

ACCESSING DATA IN PERSEUS
</a></h4>
Please read <A HREF="ch2.html#2.4">chapter 2.4</A>, Startup, in which startup procedure, the Perseus
Gateway, the Navigator Palette and Settings are described. <p>
Users unfamiliar with operating the Macintosh should read about Buttons, Pop-up
Menus and Pull-Down Menus in <A HREF="ch4.html#4.1">chapter 4.1</A>.<p>
The Perseus interface is what you see on the screen after you have started up
Perseus on your computer; the interface contains the means by which you
interact with the database (by clicking the mouse on buttons or releasing the
mouse on menu items, for example); the interface also determines the particular
format in which information (a text or a vase, for example) appears on the
screen. <p>
You gain access to the Perseus databases by descending through several levels
of the interface. The first or uppermost level is the Perseus Gateway (figure
3.1). By clicking an icon on the Gateway, you can enter one of the databases in
History, Art &amp; Archaeology, Primary Texts, etc. <p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/3.1.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 3.1 Perseus Gateway with Navigator Palette, lower left.</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>Between the Gateway and the actual data is an intermediary level
consisting of one or more Index cards, which further direct your search for
information. From the Index level you can choose a work of specific author,
say, or a Catalog card with images of a specific vase. Thus, the levels you
descend when accessing vase images are illustrated below in figure 3.2.<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/3.2.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 3.2 Interface levels from Gateway to Vase Catalog.</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>In this case the route shown is:<p>

Work. <p>
<p>
The following tasks have been designed to familiarize you with the Perseus
environment. You will bring up a famous vase painted by Douris, then explore
links from the Historical Overview of Greek History by Thomas Martin. You will
next access the text of Homer's <i>Iliad,</i>  go to the passage describing
Achilles's shield, analyze the verb form <IMG src="/img/help/vb1.gif">, and search for Homeric
uses of the word <IMG src="/img/help/polis.gif">.  The final task makes use of the Atlas to plot
the site of Athens on a color map. <p>
Perseus users often achieve good results working in groups. You may find that a
cooperative effort works well here, with you operating the computer controls
and a partner reading from the User's Guide.<p>
&gt;	Bring up images of a Kylix painted by Douris (Berlin F 2285).<p>
From the Gateway, click on the Art &amp; Archaeology icon. The Art &amp;
Archaeology Index card appears (figure 3.3). This card contains five topics:
Sites, Architecture, Sculpture, Vases, Coins. <p>
            
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/3.3.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 3.3 Art and Archaeology Index.</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>Scroll down to the Vases topic. Click <tt>Index by painter</tt>. A new
index card, Vase Index (Painter) appears with a list of painters in the field
at the left. Scroll down and click <tt>Douris</tt>. A list of vases in Perseus
2.0 by Douris appears in the field at the right. Click <tt>Berlin F 2285</tt>
and Perseus will take you to the Catalog card for this vase (figure 3.4). Click
one of the 19 Views listed at the bottom to see an image of the vase.  <p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/3.4.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 3.4 Vase Catalog card.</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>You may find the view "Side A: teacher and student with writing tablet"
of particular interest.<p>
One of Perseus's strengths is its ability to display objects in detail. Scroll
down and click on the following images: Tondo: Staff;  Side A: man on stool;
Side B: teacher and student with stylus; Side B: school.<p>
Along with the image, a floating window will appear with the photo credits. The
credits window may be closed or dragged out of the way. You may wish to bring
up other images of this vase. To do so, make the Vase Catalog card active by
clicking on it,  then click on another view.<p>
You can look at several images at one time, but be aware that images consume
memory. Perseus will remind you when your machine is getting low on RAM. Please
be sure to close the image before moving on.<p>
To read a description of the vase, click on <tt>Description</tt> in the upper
right corner of the Vase Catalog card. To return to the Gateway, click on the
Gateway (temple) icon on the Navigator Palette.<p>
For further information on Vases, see <A HREF="ch6.html#6.3.5">chapter 6.3.5</A>.<p>
&gt;	Learn about Pericles's Acropolis from the Historical Overview.<p>
From the Gateway, click on the Historical Overview icon. A card TRMartin
History TOC appears. Scroll down the outline to item <tt>9.4.4 Pericles's
Acropolis</tt>, and click on it. Perseus will take you to the corresponding
section of Martin's narrative history. <p>
The text contains links with other resources in the Perseus database; to see
the links, click on the button <tt>See Links/Lock Text</tt> in the upper right.
<p>
This is a toggle button. Its name switches between the modes <tt>See Links/Lock
Text </tt>and<tt> Hide Links/Unlock Text </tt>depending on which mode it is set
at. To select and copy text, you must use the Unlock Text setting.<p>
It will be observed that several words or phrases in the text are now
underlined. Find the phrase <tt>Athenian Acropolis </tt>and keep the mouse
clicked down on it. A pop-up menu appears offering three choices (figure 3.5).
<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/3.5.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 3.5 Historical Overview showing link at Athenian Acropolis.</b><p></CENTER><b></b>Release the mouse on the first choice, <tt>Acropolis Aerial View
[View]</tt>. Along with the image, Perseus will bring up a floating window with
the photo credits. The credits window may be closed or dragged out of the way.
To return to the Historical Overview, make it the active window by clicking on
it. Try the second choice from the Athenian Acropolis link releasing the mouse
on <tt>Paus. 1.22.4-28.3 [Text]</tt>. Perseus will take you to the relevant
passage in the Greek-English text of Pausanias Book 1. To return from Pausanias
to the Historical Overview, click on the Go Back (bent) arrow on the Navigator
Palette. To page forward and backward in the Overview, use the arrows on the

<b>Figure 3.7 Primary Text with Go To feature.</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>Type 18.509 into the box and click Go (or press Return). Perseus will
take you to the point  in the passage where Homer describes the City at War.
Note that the lines on this card (490-526) are given under Reference. Scroll up
or down in the Greek or English texts to see more of the passage.<p>
&gt;	Use Morphological Analysis tool to parse the verb form <IMG src="/img/help/vb1.gif">.<p>
In this exercise, you will be opening new windows for the Morphological
Analysis Tool and the Lexicon. Be sure to hold down the shift key down while
opening new windows in order to retain the previous window.<p>
In line 509, select (i.e., click-drag with the mouse) the word <IMG src="/img/help/vb1.gif">.
Click the button <tt>Analyze</tt> (figure 3.8).<p>
Note that you must select Greek text by dragging the mouse, not by
double-clicking.<p>

For further information on Primary Texts and Philological Tools, see chapter
8.<p>
A note on HyperCard technique: when you are in the HyperCard application, it is
only necessary to single-click the mouse. This is a departure from the standard
Macintosh technique of double-clicking to open a document. <p>
To begin the following examples, return to the Perseus Gateway by clicking the
Gateway (temple) icon on the Navigator Palette.<p>
&gt;	Plot Athens on a color map.<p>
From the Gateway, click on the Atlas icon, or choose <tt>Atlas</tt> from the
Links menu. The entry point for the Atlas, the Small Outline map, appears along
with a new floating window called the Atlas Tools Palette. Now click the button
<tt>Graphic Index of Maps</tt>. The Graphic Map Index, a black and white
outline map of the Greek world with active tiles, will appear (figure 3.12). <p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/3.12.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 3.12 Graphic Map Index, Atlas Tools Palette, Tile containing

<b></b>The fifteen tiles or rectangles superimposed on the map are actually
pop-up menus. Observe that the rectangles become highlighted when the mouse is
passed over them. Locate the mouse over Attica (second row from top, third
rectangle from left). Now hold down the mouse, and a pop-up menu appears
offering a variety of color maps. Release the mouse on the top choice,
<tt>Color elevation map with rivers and </tt>Perseus will bring up a color map,

USING TOOLS TO SEARCH AND ORGANIZE DATA IN PERSEUS
</a></h4>
&gt;	Use the Browser tool to explore the vase collection of University Museums,
University of Mississippi.<p>
The Browser may be described as an interactive catalog, a tool that enables you
to quickly access and sort information from within the Perseus database. With
the Browser tool it is possible to choose a database (Vases, Sculpture, Coins,
Sites, and Architecture) and sort it based on a certain search context
(Collection, Shape, Ware, Context, Painter, Potter, Period, Region or
Keywords). Thus, in this example, you will make a search of Vases in Perseus
2.0 organized by Collection.<p>
You can search the database for one of the 1,437 Keywords linked with the text,
such as "Athena," "spear," or "love-making." When you choose the
<tt>Keywords</tt> search context, a further pop-up menu appears to its right
with 22 categories of Keywords from which to search. Many users find not only
that the Keywords feature provides  the most fruitful starting point for
investigations, but that it is the part of Perseus which is "the most fun to
play with." A further exercise using the Keyword search topic is found in
<A HREF="ch4.html#4.5.1">chapter 4.5.1</A>.<p>
From the Gateway, click on the Browser icon. Perseus brings up the Browser
interface (figure 3.14) on which you will see in the upper left a column of the
five databases mentioned in the paragraph above (Vases, Sculpture, Coins,
etc.). <p>
Note that results obtained by other users may still be in the Browser, and the
interface will not look exactly like the depiction in figure 3.14 until you
actually perform the search.<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/3.14.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 3.14 Browser tool, showing Mississippi Collection organized by
Name.</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>Click the button to the left of <tt>Vases</tt> so that it becomes
highlighted. Now choose the item <tt>Collection</tt> under the pop-up menu,
upper middle (in figure 3.14 the pop-up reads <tt>Collection is...</tt>).
Scroll down to <tt>University Museums, University of Mississippi</tt> and click
anywhere on that line. Perseus will display the results of the search in the
three columns below, sorted by Name. Click on a Vase Name in the left column,
and Perseus will take you to its Vase Catalog card. <p>
If the search result Name does not appear, select Name from the pop-up menu at
the top of the left column. Each of the three columns is headed by a pop-up
menu. You can customize the display of search results by selecting the desired
result from the pop-up menus. Note that only the left column of Browser results
is active.<p>
If part of the vase's Name in the left column is cut off, change the width of a
column by holding the cursor at the top of the vertical dividing line and
dragging to change the column width; note that the cursor changes from Pointer
to Field-expander mode (figure 3.15).<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/3.15.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 3.15 Expand the Browser results column.</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>A good vase to start with might be Mississippi 1977.3.69, attributed to
the Theseus Painter, a depiction of Dionysos in a donkey-cart preceded by a man
and a goat. To go to the Catalog card for this vase, scroll down to Mississippi
1977.3.69 and click it. There are 33 views of this vase; to see a view, click
it.<p>
To return to the Browser, click the Go Back (bent) arrow on the Naviator
Palette. Your search will remain in the Browser until you make another search
or quit Perseus.<p>
You do not need to return to the Gateway when navigating from one place to
another in Perseus. You can directly access the Browser, for example, by
releasing the mouse on <tt>Browser</tt> under the Links menu. The other Perseus
databases and tools can be accessed directly from the Links menu as well.<p>
For further information on the Browser, see <A HREF="ch5.html#5.1">chapter 5.1</A>. To find out how to
save the results of your search, see the discussion on the Search Saver tool ,
<A HREF="ch5.html#5.3">chapter 5.3</A>.<p>
&gt;	Use the Lookup tool to locate information about Akragas contained in the
various Perseus resources.<p>
The Lookup tool, reached via the Links menu, is a quick way to access
information in Perseus. Lookup often will be among the first tools you use to
start an inquiry; it is certainly the easiest to use: just type in a word or
lookup string, press <tt>Return,</tt> and Perseus will list a number of
options; click on an option and Perseus will take you there. (For a definition
of lookup strings, see <A HREF="ch8b.html#8.4.1">section 8.4.1</A>.) The Lookup Tool draws on a database
consisting of all English words indexed in Perseus, a number in the tens of
thousands. Built into the Lookup tool is a list of alternate spellings, such as
Clytemnestra/Klytaimestra or Aegina/Aigina, to 3. you reach the desired
target.<p>
From anywhere in Perseus, release the mouse on <tt>Lookup</tt> under the Links
menu. A floating window appears (figure 3.16). The cursor should be on the left
and blinking. Type <tt>Akragas </tt>and press<tt> Return</tt>. <p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/3.16.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 3.16 The Lookup tool.</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>The Lookup window will now expand. Displayed on the left under <tt>Could
be...</tt> is <tt>akragas</tt>, the canonical listing for this word in Perseus.
Below the line are the various alternate spellings for Akragas (figure 3.17).
Databases containing Akragas are displayed on the right.<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/3.17.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 3.17 Lookup results</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>Note that Lookup is not case sensitive, i.e., it is not necessary to
distinguish upper from lower case letters. However, you will need to be
mindful of the canonical author abbreviations when looking up texts: hom. od.
10.45 will work, but not homer od X 45; see Appendix A or the card
<tt>Canonical Abbreviations for Primary Texts </tt>in Online 3..<p>
Click <tt>Site Catalog</tt> on the right. Perseus will take you to the Akragas
card of the Site Catalog. (The Lookup window may be dragged out of the way.)
From the Site Catalog card you can bring up Views of Akragas by clicking one of
the lines at the bottom. To bring up thumbnail images of the Akragas views, a
description of the site, or to go to the Site Index, click one of the buttons
in the upper right. <p>
Return to the Lookup window and try some of the other options Perseus has
listed for Akragas. If it has disappeared, select <tt>Lookup</tt> from Links
menu, type in <tt>Akragas</tt> again and press <tt>Return</tt>. <p>
If you have a specific text or object in mind, you do not have to go through
the various index levels to access it. Select <tt>Lookup</tt> from the Links
menu. Type in what you want to find and press Return. Note that you must type
in the name of the text or object according to the canonical list of Perseus
contents found in Appendix B. For further information on the Lookup tool, see
<A HREF="ch4.html#4.5.1">chapter 4.5.1</A>.

USING PATHS TO TAKE GUIDED TOURS OF PERSEUS
</a></h3>
It is possible to record what locations you have visited in Perseus. Such a
recording is called a Path, and each stop on the Path are called a Location.
Perseus 2.0 comes with four prerecorded Paths intended to familiarize users at
various levels and interests with the Perseus environment. Included also is a
selection of Paths that have been created in order to show off Perseus's
various strengths. For detailed information on creating, editing and following
Paths, see <A HREF="ch10.html#10.1">chapter 10.1</A>. <p>
For the following examples, it is assumed that you know how to start up Perseus
and adjust the Settings. Please read about these procedures in <A HREF="ch12.html#2.4">chapter 2.4</A>. To
take the Guided Tours of Perseus 2.0, you only need to know how to use the Path
Navigator (described below).<p>
The Path Navigator is located on the Navigator Palette. <p>

ONLINE HELP
</a></h3>
Online 3. is available throughout Perseus by clicking the 3. icon on the
Navigator Palette or choosing Help from the Perseus menu. Help offers both
general information on how to operate Perseus and context-related information
about the current stack (i.e., your present location inside Perseus). Topics in
Online 3. are cross-referenced with each other and referenced tothis user's
guide.<p>
It is important to understand that the term "Stack" refers to the electronic
place where data is stored in Perseus. "Stack" is the organizational metaphor
for HyperCard, the software application on which Perseus is based. A stack is
composed of a number of electronic "notecards." <p>
&gt;	From the Gateway, click the <tt>Help</tt> (question mark) icon on the
Navigator Palette.<p>
When you request Help, information for the current stack appears (figure 3.21).
Each icon on the Perseus Gateway represents a stack; 3. on the texts is given
at the level of the Primary Text Index stack; 3. on Art &amp; Archaeology is
given at the level of the Catalog stack. The Help topic is shown at the top
left, and the number of pages about this topic is shown at the top right.  <p>

topic.<p>
Tips &amp; Hints is an additional element of the Help system that offers
techniques and reminders for a particular topic. This information will 3. you
save time, avoid mistakes, and use Perseus more efficiently.<p>
From any Tips &amp; Hints card, you can see the Topic List or go directly to
the stack being described. To return from the Tips &amp; Hints card to the main
Help, click <tt>Tips &amp; Hints</tt> or the go back arrow at the top right.<p>
&gt;	The <tt>Tips &amp; Hints</tt> button toggles to read <tt>Main Help</tt>
(while you are on the Tips &amp; Hints card) . Click the button <tt>Main
Help</tt> to return to the main Help.<p>
&gt;	Click <tt>Topic List</tt> to see a content list of general topics and
stack topics.<p>
The general topics include Getting Started, Perseus Basics, and Utilities. The
stack topics are grouped by Browsing Tools and Indexes, Art and Archaeology,
Atlas, Primary Texts, Philological Tools, Historical Overview, References, and
Supporting Information. Use the arrows to page ahead and back when the topic
offers more than one page of Help.<p>
&gt;	Scroll down in the Stack Topics list, and click <tt>Small Site Plans</tt>
under the Art &amp; Archaeology category.<p>
Some Help topics, such as the Small Site Plans topic shown in figure 3.22, show

<b></b>&gt;	Click <tt>Go to This Stack</tt> to go to the Small Site Plans
stack.<p>
Any Help topic that describes a Perseus stack has a button that takes you
directly to that stack from Help. General topics in Help do not have this
button. A stack opened directly from Help opens in a new window rather than
replacing the Help window, regardless of the setting registered on the Settings
card.<p>
&gt;	Close the stack you opened from Help (Small Site Plans).<p>
&gt;	When you return to the Help topic for Small Site Plans, you may choose
related 3. topics from the <tt>See Also...</tt> menu.<p>
In this example of the Small Site Plans, there is one See Also topic, the Large
Site Plans. Choose <tt>Large Site Plans</tt> to see the Help topic for that
stack. You will go directly to the Help topic for Large Site Plans. Use the
<tt>See Also...</tt> pop-up menu to see the related topics here.<p>
