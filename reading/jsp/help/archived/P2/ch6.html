 HISTORICAL OVERVIEW
</a></h3>
<IMG src="/img/help/6.1a.gif"><p>
A Historical Overview of Greek History was commissioned by the Perseus Project.
Written by Professor Thomas Martin, the Overview is a narrative history of
ancient Greece with emphasis on the Golden Age of Athens in the fifth century
B.C. <p>
The Historical Overview consists of two parts, a table of contents and a
narrative section. Within the narrative, words and phrases in the text are
linked to the primary text sources, images, maps, and plans that comprise
Perseus. Each link may have more than one possible destination, chosen from a
pop-up menu.<p>
Use the Historical Overview to investigate interrelated items from a historical
context.<p>
To open this resource, click the Historical Overview icon on the Gateway or
choose <tt>Historical Overview</tt> from the Links menu.
<h4>
<a name="6.1.1">6.1.1
TABLE OF CONTENTS

TOPICS
</a></h4>
Each topic in the Historical Overview appears on a separate card. Topic 9.1.5,
The Rebellion of Thasos, is depicted below (figure 6.2).<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/6.2.gif"><p>
<b>			Figure 6.2 Topic 9.1.5, The Rebellion of Thasos.</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>Each topic card is titled "Thomas R. Martin, An Overview of Classical
Greek History from Homer to Alexander." The topic's location in the outline is
shown above the narrative; this area is active, meaning that you can click
there to move from the current topic up to a section or sub-section. Below the
main title bar are two buttons, used to return to the Table of Contents and to
perform the action Hide Links/Unlock Text. <p>
Click the right and left arrows on the Navigator Palette to move forward and
backward in the Historical Overview.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC5">Linked
Text and Locked Text
</a></h5>
A toggle button changes the state of the text between shown and hidden links
and between locked and unlocked text. This button is named Hide Links/Unlock
Text or Show Links/Lock Text, depending on the state of the toggle. <p>
Narrative in the Historical Overview is linked thematically to other Perseus
resources. Linked text is underlined in gray and appears when the text field is
locked. Text may also be unlocked so that you can use the text select tool to
select text. After selecting text, you can use the Links Menu to find
connections in other resources, or you can use the Perseus Menu to add the card
to a Perseus path with selected text. For more information, see <A HREF="ch4.html#4.5">chapter 4.5</A> on
the Links Menu and <A HREF="ch10.html#10.2">chapter 10.2</A> on Paths. <p>
&gt;	Click Hide Links/Unlock Text to disable the links to other Perseus
resources.<p>
Note that the name of the button changes (toggles). When text is unlocked, you
can change as well as select the text on the screen. These changes are not
permanent, and they disappear when you leave the card.<p>
&gt;	Click Show Links/Lock Text to enable the links.<p>
	In figure 6.2, the phrase "case of the city-state of the island of Thasos" is
linked to other parts of Perseus.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC6">Use
an existing link
</a></h5>
&gt;	Click an underlined phrase to see a pop-up menu of the links from that
word. <p>
To follow the example here, choose the phrase <tt>case of the city-state of the
island of Thasos</tt>.<p>
Links in the Historical Overview are coded according to category. Links to
other parts of Perseus include the Atlas, site plans, texts, and views. Links
to primary texts are indicated by the standard or Perseus canonical system of
abbreviations, which includes the author, work, and references to the book,
chapter, and line, as applicable. Appendix B contains the standard system of
abbreviations used in the Historical Overview links.<p>
A pop-up menu for the linked text is depicted below (figure 6.3). The phrase in
this figure is linked to a Primary Text, the Atlas, two Views, a Site and the
Browsing Tool.<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/6.3.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 6.3 Pop-up menu for linked text.</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>&gt;	Choose a link from the pop-up menu. <p>
Try each available link in this example. To keep the Overview window open while
linking with a resource, hold the shift key down while releasing the mouse.
Please remember to close the recently-opened window when moving on. <p>
&gt;	Click the Go Back icon on the Navigator Palette to return to the
Historical Overview card from Primary Text or the Atlas. Close an image by
clicking the box in the upper-left corner.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC7">Try
your own link
</a></h5>
As with almost all of the Perseus resources, you can explore the relations of
narrative, primary texts, maps, and images by using the Lookup tool.<p>
&gt;	Use the Lookup tool to find links of your own.<p>
Click <tt>Hide Links/Unlock Text</tt> on the same topic described in the above
example (9.1.5, The Rebellion of Thasos) so that you can select text. Highlight
the word <tt>Thasos</tt> in the ninth line of text.<p>
From the Links Menu, choose Lookup.<p>
Because you have activated this choice on the Links Menu while a word was
selected in your current location, Perseus has entered the selected text into
the Lookup tool. Press Return, and in a few seconds, you will see a list of
links for Thasos within Perseus (figure 6.4). Select a line to go to its
link.<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/6.4.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 6.4 Lookup tool showing possible links for "Thasos."</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>For more information on the Lookup tool, see <A HREF="ch4.html#4.5">chapter 4.5</A>. Click the Go
Back arrow on the Navigator Palette to return to your place in the Historical
Overview. You may need to click several times, slowly.<p>
Another way to make a link is with the English Index. Again, highlight
<tt>Thasos</tt> from the text of the Historical Overview. Choose <tt>English
Index</tt> from the Links menu. The English Index will make the search for you.

 ESSAYS &amp; CATALOGS
</a></h3>
Perseus includes several essays on art, archaeology, the Athenian court system,
biographies, music and regions of Greece. Some of the essays were commissioned
by the Perseus Project and written by scholars with a particular area of
expertise. Others were prepared independently of Perseus for publication in
other sources. All the scholarly works have integral ties to the Perseus
resources, such as text citations and object descriptions. <p>
Each essay consists of two parts, a table of contents and a narrative section.
Within the narrative, underlined words indicate a direct link to another part
of Perseus. You can select the underlined words and choose a menu item from the
Links menu to go directly to the reference. Advance from page to page in the
Essays by clicking the Go Forward arrow on the Navigator Palette.<p>
In the Historical Overview links are made from a pop-up menu; in the Essays and
Catalogs, links to other Perseus resources are made by clicking an illustration
or selecting text.<p>
To open this resource, click the Essays &amp; Catalogs icon on the Gateway or
choose <tt>Essays &amp; Catalogs</tt> from the Links menu.

<tt>Search</tt>, and Perseus will find the first instance of the word or
phrase. Click <tt>Cancel</tt> if you change your mind.<p>
There are many other references in the essay to vases and secondary sources.
Those which are underlined indicate links within Perseus to specific vases and
to the Sources Used stack. You can recognize vases because their references
begin with the collection name, such as Boston, Munich, and so on. To see one
of these reference links, select it then choose the <tt>Lookup</tt> tool from
the Links menu.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC11">Other
Vase Painting essays in Perseus.

 CASKEY-BEAZLEY VASE CATALOGS
</a></h4>
In 1931-63, L.D. Caskey and J.D. Beazley published catalogs describing Attic
vase paintings in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. This work has remained a
valuable reference for any study of Greek vase painting. All of the 176 vases
described by Caskey and Beazley are in the Perseus vase catalog.<p>
The first card in this stack is the Table of Contents (figure 6.7).  Select a
vase from this list by scrolling down to locate the vase you want, then
clicking once on the line describing it.  The program will search for that vase
and take you to the catalog card where its description starts.<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/6.7.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 6.7 Caskey &amp; Beazley Table of Contents.</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>The catalog cards contain five buttons, upper right, and are divided
into three parts: a top area containing navigation and display tools, a central
area where the catalog text is displayed, and a bottom area listing the
available views of the vase (figure 6.8).  This bottom part can be hidden or
displayed by clicking once on the <tt>Hide Views/Show Views</tt> button.<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/6.8.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 6.8 Caskey-Beazley catalog. Note the Hide/Show Views button is
toggled to show Views.</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>Clicking on the Table of Contents button returns you to the table of
contents. <p>
The Vase Catalog button provides a link to the full Perseus vase catalog (of
which Views is the bottom part).<p>
&gt;	To go to the Vase Catalog card, select an underlined vase reference (i.e.,
<u>Boston 01.8025</u>) and click the mouse on the <tt>Vase Catalog</tt>
button.<p>
Bibliographical references contained in the Perseus Bibliography are usually
cited in an abbreviated form and underlined. Examples may be seen in the next
card of the Caskey-Beazley catalog, Additional Bibliography.  <p>
&gt;	To look up any underlined bibliographic references, select the reference
where it appears in the catalog, (e.g., <u>Buitron 1972</u>) then choose
<tt>Sources Used</tt> from the Links menu.<p>
Finally, it is possible to move around the Caskey-Beazley catalog by typing one
of three possible citation systems into the dialog window brought up by the
<tt>Go To</tt> button.<p>
&gt;	To go to the Caskey-Beazley card containing the Kneeling Silen, click the
<tt>Go To</tt> button and type in the Caskey-Beazley Number (No. 6), the

<a name="6.2.4">6.2.4
 HISTORICAL ESSAY
</a></h4>
The historical essay "Three Court Days" was written by Alan L. Boegehold.  The
essay is substantially a chapter (without the footnotes) in <i>The Athenian
Agora,</i> Volume 28, <i>The Lawcourts at Athens: Sites, Buildings, Equipment,
Procedure, and Testimonia</i> by Alan L. Boegehold with contributions by John
McK. Camp II, Margaret Crosby, Mabel Lang, David R. Jordan and Rhys F.Townsend,
(American School of Classical Studies at Athens, 1995).<p>
The essay provides three accounts of the way a trial may have occurred on three
separate occasions in a span of one hundred and forty years. The days fall
within the periods 460 to 410 (roughly), 409-340, and 340 (roughly) to 322. <p>
"Three Court Days" works in the same way as vase painting essays in Perseus. It
is indexed by a table of contents. Click topic lines to see the body of the
essay. Within the body of the essay, paragraphs are shown on separate cards.
They are titled by paragraph number within each of the six sections. For
example, Paragraph 4.13 is the thirteenth paragraph within section 4. To go to
the next paragraph within this section, use the forward arrow on the Navigator
Palette. To go to the beginning of the section, click its title in the field
above the text. Click the <tt>Table of Contents</tt> button in the upper right
to return to the topic list.<p>
At certain points in the essay there are references to texts in Perseus. These
references are indicated by an underline (figure 6.10). To go directly to a
text reference, highlight the text, then choose Lookup  from the Links menu and
press Return. Remember that you can open the text reference in a new window by
holding the shift key down while choosing an item from the Links menu. (The
Settings option lets you specify whether windows will be opened as an addition
or replacement to the current window. Holding the shift key down while you
click temporarily reverses this choice.)<p>

 ART &amp; ARCHAEOLOGY
</a></h3>
<IMG src="/img/help/6.3a.gif"><p>
Perseus contains information, illustrations, and images about the art and
archaeology of ancient Greece. The Art &amp; Archaeology resource is the main
repository for this information, although relevant entries are also found in
the essays, the Encyclopedia, and other resources in Perseus. Information is
contained in five catalogs:  Sites, Architecture, Sculpture, Pottery, and
Coins. Each catalog is organized according to a structure based on the unique
characteristics of its objects. For example, Architecture is indexed by site,
building type, period, and date, while Coins are indexed by collection, mint,
region, issuing authority, denomination, period and date.<p>
All objects in the Art &amp; Archaeology catalogs are documented in text and
visual formats. Each object is documented according to the best information
available. Not all characteristics are known for all objects, however, and so
there are sometimes blanks. Again, dates identified for archaeological objects
are approximate. Each entry is accompanied by color photographs and illustrated
site plans, as applicable. The catalogs are also linked with one another. For
example, the Sculpture catalog indicates the building on which a sculpture is
located, and the Architecture catalog indicates the site at which the building
is located. <p>
The Browser (described in <A HREF="ch5.html#5.1">chapter 5.1</A>) provides a primary point of entry to the
Art &amp; Archaeology catalogs. The Browser searches for objects by attribute
or keyword and summarizes the results of the search in textual and visual
formats. From the Browser you can investigate individual objects in detail by
opening the Art &amp; Archaeology catalogs. You may also use the catalog
indexes and the Links menu to open the Art &amp; Archaeology catalogs.
<h4>
<a name="6.3.1">6.3.1
ART &amp; ARCHAEOLOGY INDEX
</a></h4>
The Art &amp; Archaeology Index is accessible by clicking the Art &amp;
Archaeology icon on the Perseus Gateway. The catalogs and indexes of Art &amp;
Archaeology are presented in a scrolling text field (figure 6.11).<p>
      
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/6.11.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 6.11  Art &amp; Archaeology Index.</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>&gt;	Click an index name under one of the Art &amp; Archaeology
catalogs.<p>
Perseus displays a detailed index of the resources available for the selected
category. For example, if you clicked "Index by region" under the category
Sites, a detailed index of sites sorted by region appears.

 SITES
</a></h4>
<IMG src="/img/help/6.3.2.gif">
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC18">Site
Indexes
</a></h5>
Sites are indexed in three ways: by region, type, and period. All sites are
also listed alphabetically. The description here uses the Index by region as an
example. Regions encompass cities or sites that may have belonged to different
political units at different times. Assignment of cities and sites to regions
follows accepted conventions for the classical period. <p>
&gt;	From the Gateway, click the Art &amp; Archaeology icon, then click
<tt>Index by region</tt>  under the topic <tt>Sites</tt>. Or choose
<tt>Sites</tt> from the Links menu, then choose the item <tt>Region</tt> from
the <tt>Index Type</tt> pop-up menu.<p>
Perseus displays a more detailed index that shows the list of sites in the left
column. On any of the detailed index displays, the list in the left column is
based on the type of index selected, which is indicated by the icon and title
at the top of the display. The detailed index for sites listed by region is
depicted below (figure 6.12).<p>
      
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/6.12.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 6.12  Site Index by Region.</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>&gt;	Choose a different index from the <tt>Index Type</tt> pop-up

Try the other three indexes. Return to <tt>Index by Region</tt> to follow the
rest of this description, which will use the site at Delphi by way of
example.<p>
&gt;	Scroll down and click <tt>Phocis</tt> under the region list in the left
column.<p>
The left column lists regions. The right column lists the sites in the selected
region, Phocis. The name of the selected region appears above the right column.
<p>
The sites are listed in two categories: Documented Sites and Photographs Only.
Documented Sites means that the site has a full catalog entry. Photographs Only
means that the catalog entry has only a Site Summary, blank except for region
information. Undocumented sites are included to provide access to Perseus
images of these sites.<p>
&gt;	Click <tt>Delphi</tt> under the site list in the right column.<p>
For sites listed under Documented, the full catalog entry consists of a Site
Summary and a Site Description.
<h5>

Perseus displays a Summary of the selected site.<p>
The Site Summary for Delphi is depicted below (figure 6.13). The name of this

Site plans and photographic views accompany the sites. Large and small
composite site plans are described later in this chapter. Views are described
immediately below.<p>
The views are digitized images or videodisc still-frames, depending on your
Perseus Settings and your equipment. The views available for the selected site
are listed alphabetically below the site information. The number of views
available is also displayed.<p>
&gt;	Click a view to see a digitized or videodisc image.<p>
Your Perseus Settings (available from the Gateway) control the display of
digitized images, videodisc images, or both. Image credits appear in a floating
window that can be closed or repositioned on the screen. Settings are described
in general in <A HREF="ch4.html#4.2">chapter 4.2</A> and in detail in <A HREF="ch10.html#10.5">chapter 10.5</A>.<p>
&gt;	Click the close box of the image, upper left, if you are using digitized
images.<p>
NOTE: The images are not stored in HyperCard and therefore should be treated
differently from other Perseus elements. In particular, you must click the
close box to remove an image. If the window is not active, click in the title
bar. If you use the Navigator while an image window is open, Perseus will
respond, but you will be unable to see the response if the image window is
covering the active HyperCard window.
<h5>

Each white or black bar on the scale at the left of the image represents actual
size of one centimetre.<p>
&gt;	Click the close box of the image, if you are using digitized images.<p>
NOTE: The images are not stored in HyperCard. You must click the close box to
remove an image. If the window is not active, click in the title bar. If you
use the Navigator while an image window is open, Perseus will respond, but you
will be unable to see the response if the image window is covering the active
HyperCard window.

Description
</a></h6>
The Coin Description is in a format similar to the Site Description. Unlike the
other archaeological objects, coin descriptions tend to be very brief. The
Description button displays the descriptive part of the coin article. The Index
button returns you to the Coin Index. <p><A HREF="ch5.html"><IMG ALIGN=Left src="/img/help/la.gif" WIDTH=75 BORDER=3 ALT="Go Back"></A><A HREF="ch7.html"><IMG ALIGN=Right src="/img/help/ra.gif" WIDTH=75 BORDER=3 ALT="Go Forward"></A><br>
