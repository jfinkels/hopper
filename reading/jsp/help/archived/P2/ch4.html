<p><CENTER><h2>CHAPTER
4:  TOOLS FOR NAVIGATING PERSEUS</h2></CENTER>
<HR><br>
This chapter describes how to find your way through Perseus. It begins with the
special ways that Perseus uses the various controls and buttons native to the
Macintosh system and HyperCard and then explains the tools that were specially
programmed in order to navigate through Perseus. This guide assumes that you
are familiar with basic Macintosh vocabulary and standard Macintosh techniques,
such as clicking and dragging with the mouse, using pop-up and pull-down menus,
etc. If you need more help with the basics of the Macintosh system or a
detailed description of HyperCard, consult the bibliography in the back of this
guide; see also the original disks and documentation for the Macintosh system
and your copy of HyperCard.<p>
Basic Macintosh and Hypercard terminology is covered in <A HREF="#4.1">section 4.1</A>.
Descriptions of Perseus-specific buttons, menus and windows begin with <A HREF="#4.2">section

 BUTTONS, MENUS AND WINDOWS
</a></h3>
<h4>
<a name="4.1.1">4.1.1
BUTTONS
</a></h4>
Perseus uses several types of buttons to retrieve information. Three types of
buttons are depicted below (figure 4.1).<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/4.1.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 4.1  Types of buttons</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>Some buttons are toggles:  clicking one turns a feature on or off, and
the name on the button or the highlighted active area changes correspondingly.
For example, clicking a button called "Show Links" reveals link areas in a text
field. The name of the button then changes to "Hide Links," which is the user's
cue to click that button again to hide the link areas in the text field.
<h4>
<a name="4.1.2">4.1.2
MENUS
</a></h4>
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC5">Pop-up
Menus
</a></h5>
Pop-up menus provide multiple choices from a button. Buttons that contain
pop-up menus are shown as rectangles with shadows. To see the choices in a
pop-up menu, point the cursor over the button and hold the mouse button down.
While you hold the mouse button down, a list of choices pops up. Move the
cursor over your choice and release the mouse. If you do not want to make a
choice, move the cursor outside the boundary of the pop-up menu and release the
mouse.<p>
The active choice in a pop-up menu is registered in one of three ways. One way
is a check mark placed next to the choice in the pop-up menu. The second is
that the choice now appears as the name of the pop-up menu. The third is an
action that occurs as soon as you release the mouse button. A pop-up menu from
a button is depicted below (figure 4.2). This menu allows you to set the type
of videodisc player.<p>
                
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/4.2.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 4.2 Pop-up menu</b></CENTER>
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC6">Pull-down
Menus
</a></h5>
Pull-down menus provide choices from the menu bar. In addition to the menus
regularly available through HyperCard, two menus are consistently available as
you move through the Perseus resources. These two  menus are Links and Perseus.
The Links Menu remains the same throughout Perseus. The items contained under
the Perseus Menu depend on your location and path within Perseus. The Perseus
Menu is depicted below (figure 4.3).<p>
                  
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/4.3.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 4.3 Perseus Menu.</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>Three specialized menus accompany some Perseus resources and appear on
the right end of the menu bar when you open the resource. These menus provide
tools, functions, and links designed to expand the power and flexibility of the
Perseus resource. The Plan Menu appears only when a Site Plan is on the screen,
the Atlas Menu appears when you go to the Atlas and the Text Menu is displayed
when you select a Primary Text.<p>
Detailed explanations of the Links and Perseus menus are offered at the end of
this chapter. Descriptions of specialized menus are included in the chapters
describing the Perseus features that use them.
<h4>
<a name="4.1.3">4.1.3
WINDOWS
</a></h4>
Perseus uses the HyperCard features of multiple stack windows and a scroll
window.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC8">Multiple
Open Windows
</a></h5>
Perseus allows you to keep several windows open at the same time. If you
choose, you may turn this function off in the Settings card. See <A HREF="#4.2">section 4.2</A>
below. <p>
Perseus will warn you if your memory is running low because too many windows
have been left open.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC9">Open
another stack window
</a></h5>
When the Multiple Open Windows option is switched off, it can be manually
applied. To do so, hold down the Shift key while you click to go to a new
card.<p>
Only windows from different stacks can be seen at the same time; you cannot
have two windows from the same stack open simultaneously. 
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC10">Make
a window active
</a></h5>
&gt;	Click anywhere on a window to make it active.<p>
Only one window is active at any time. The active window is shown at the
forefront of other windows and has a striped title bar. Inactive windows have
plain white title bars. Although you can open several windows, available RAM
restricts the number of windows that can be open at any time. If you open too
many windows, you may see a warning message, or, in extreme cases, the program
may spontaneously quit. 
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC11">Close
windows
</a></h5>
&gt;	Click the close box in the upper left-hand corner of the title bar.<p>
Windows can accumulate on the screen and clutter the desktop. Close any windows
you are not using. When only one Perseus window is open, its title bar does not
have a close box.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC12">Scroll
Window
</a></h5>
A scroll window (figure 4.4) is a tool for resizing windows and moving around
windows that are bigger than the current screen (for example, some Atlas
drawings and the Large Site Plans). They appear automatically when an image
exceeds the screen size. The black rectangle in the middle of the scroll window
outlines the region of the window currently displayed. <p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/4.4a.gif"><IMG src="/img/help/4.4b.gif"><p>
<b>	Figure 4.4 Scroll windows with Pointer Hand and with Arrow in Black
Rectangle.</b></CENTER>
<h6>
<a name="RTFToC13">Move
around the window
</a></h6>
&gt;	Position the cursor in the middle of the black rectangle in the scroll
window. The cursor becomes an open hand.<p>
&gt;	Click the black rectangle with the hand and then drag it to show a
different region of the map. 
<h6>
<a name="RTFToC14">Resize
the window
</a></h6>
&gt;	Position the cursor near an edge or corner of the black rectangle. The
cursor takes the shape of an arrow, pointing in the direction in which you can
change the dimension of the rectangle.<p>
&gt;	Click the black rectangle with the arrow and then drag it to the desired
size. The size of the window display changes, reflecting the change in
dimension of the black rectangle. <p>
NOTE: You can bring up the scrolling window by pressing the key combination
command-e, and put the scrolling window away again by again pressing command-e.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC15">Photograph
and Illustration Windows
</a></h5>
Many illustrations and all digitized photographs are not HyperCard stacks and
therefore behave differently than the windows described above. In particular,
you must click the close box to remove an illustration, because it will not be
replaced or closed automatically by an action in Perseus. The window must be
active for the close box to appear (the active window has a striped title bar).
To make a window active, click in the title bar area. The close box should now
appear.<p>
If you use the Navigator Palette while a photograph or illustration window is
open, you may not notice that it is having an effect on the Perseus HyperCard
resources. This is particularly true if you have opened a large photograph or
illustration window that hides much of the screen behind it.<p>

PERSEUS GATEWAY
</a></h3>
The Gateway (figure 4.5) is the point of entry into Perseus. The Gateway
contains buttons that link you to Perseus resources and utilities, and to the
HyperCard Home stack. The Gateway also provides information about the Perseus
Project and the Annenberg/CPB Project, which provided the major funding for
Perseus. <p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/4.5.gif"><p>
<b>                              Figure 4.5 Perseus Gateway </b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>The Browser, Historical Overview, Essays &amp; Catalogs, Tools &amp;
References, Art &amp; Archaeology, Atlas, and Primary Texts are the major
resources of Perseus. Paths, Settings, Home, and Information are utilities.
<h4>
<a name="4.2.1">4.2.1
PERSEUS RESOURCES
</a></h4>
&gt;	Click the button of the resource you would like to use:  Browser,
Historical Overview, Essays &amp; Catalogs, Tools &amp; References, Art &amp;
Archaeology, Atlas, or Primary Texts. You will be taken to the Index level of
the resource you have chosen.
<h4>
<a name="4.2.2">4.2.2
SETTINGS
</a></h4>
<IMG src="/img/help/4.2.2.gif"><p>
This section provides an overview of Settings. For detailed instructions,
please see <A HREF="ch10.html#10.5">chapter 10.5</A>.<p>
&gt;	Click the Settings icon to go to the Settings card.<p>
Use the Settings function to customize your Perseus system. You can specify
settings for a videodisc player, image displays, and the control of windows.
For details on installation and set up procedures and information on how to run
Perseus on a configuration other than the default single Mac/single cd-rom
player, see chapter 2, <A HREF="ch2.html#2.2">sections 2 </A>and <A HREF="ch2.html#2.4">4</A>.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC19">Videodisc
players, Cd-rom digital images, Indexed color
</a></h5>
If you will be running Perseus with a videodisc player, click the box <tt>Use
Video Images</tt>, and choose the appropriate model from the <tt>Select Player
Type </tt>Pop-up menu .<p>
NOTE: We can recommend only the videodisc players listed here and on the
Settings card. Other models may not be compatible with Perseus. These models
include Hitachi 9550, Pioneer 4200, Pioneer 6000A, Pioneer 6010A, Sony LDP
1200, Sony 1500, Sony 2000.<p>
If you will be displaying images only on the computer monitor, click the box
<tt>Use Digital Images.</tt>It is possible to display images from both the
videodisc  and the cd-rom at the same time. In this case, click both the Video
Images and Digital Images boxes.<p>
If your computer is running with an 8-bit color maximum, click the Indexed
Color box. 8-bit color shows up as "256" in the <tt>Settings of selected
monitor </tt>field in the Monitors control panel in your system folder
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC20">Window
control 
</a></h5>
The button <tt>Go to cards in new window</tt> allows you to have more than one
Perseus stack open on the desktop at any time. With this feature switched on,
when you open a new stack, it will appear in an additional window, while the
card from the old stack remains in an open window left in the background on the
screen. <p>
The button <tt>Go to cards in same window </tt>allows you to open a new stack
in the current window, the new stack replacing the current stack. The advantage
of opening cards in new windows is the ability to view several resources at
once. <p>
The Multiple Open Windows feature does not apply to image windows, which are a
separate type of window that always open in addition to the stack window.

<IMG src="/img/help/4.2.3.gif"><p>
&gt;	If you have HyperCard installed in your system, click the Home icon to go
to the Home card.<p>
You may wish to go directly to the Home card when you are finished using
Perseus if you plan to use HyperCard in another application. You can also go to
the Home card to review and adjust your search paths for Perseus. Refer to

<a name="4.3">4.3
NAVIGATOR PALETTE
</a></h3>
Users can navigate through the resources in Perseus by using the Navigator
Palette (figure 4.6). The Navigator Palette is a small floating window that can
be positioned anywhere on the screen and is always active, regardless of the
number of windows open on the screen. <p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/4.6.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 4.6 Navigator Palette.</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>&gt;	Move the Navigator Palette by clicking the title bar and dragging
the Palette to the desired place on the screen. <p>
&gt;	Make the Navigator Palette reappear by choosing Navigator from the Perseus
pull-down menu.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC26">Use
Search Saver
</a></h5>
       
<IMG src="/img/help/4.8a.gif"><p>
The Search Saver is a new feature of Perseus 2.0 that lets you temporarily
store the results of searches made with tools such as the Browser, the English
Index, or the Philological Tools. The Search Saver icon on the Navigator
Palette opens the Search Saver and stores the results of a new search. You can
link to a citation in Perseus that is stored in the Search Saver by clicking on
it.<p>
Because the Search Saver window remains active and on-screen, there is no need
to go back and forth between two Perseus resources when linking to search
results, as had been necessary in version 1.0.<p>
&gt;	Save the results of a search for the word <IMG ALIGN=No src="/img/help/polis.gif"> in Homer.<p>
For this exercise, follow the instructions for Greek Word Search given in
<A HREF="ch3.html#3.1.2">Section 3.1.2</A>. <p>
Be sure you have chosen <tt>Citations for all forms</tt> from the Options
pop-up menu.<p>
Save the search by clicking the Search Saver icon on the Navigator Palette. The
citations are saved to a new floating window, the Search Saver (figure 4.7)<p>
<CENTER>                                 
<IMG src="/img/help/4.7.gif"><p>

Results loaded into the Search Saver may be copied to a Perseus Notebook for
later use. This task is automated by choosing <tt>Search Saver to Notebook
</tt>from the Perseus pull-down menu. For more details on this feature, see
<A HREF="#4.6">chapter 4.6</A> below.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC27">Get
author credits
</a></h5>
    
<IMG src="/img/help/4.9b.gif"><p>
Use Author Credits to correctly cite material from Perseus used in a paper or
publication. <p>
Where applicable, author credits for articles, descriptions and translations in
Perseus are available by clicking the Information icon. If author credits are
available, a card appears with information about the editions, sources, or the
author, as well as other information about the stack. To return to your
original location, click the Go Back icon, described below.<p>
Author information on Primary texts is available at the text level; on Art and
Archaeology stacks at the Catalog level;  on the Encyclopedia at the article
level; on the Atlas at the Small Outling Map level; on the Essays  at the Table
of Contents level; and on the Historical Overview at the text level.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC28">Get
help
</a></h5>
      
<IMG src="/img/help/4.9c.gif"><p>
Online help is available in Perseus 2.0 by clicking the Help icon on the
Navigator. It is also available from the Perseus menu. When you click Help,
Perseus opens the Help stack and presents information related to the current
stack.<A HREF="ch3.html#3.3"> Chapter 3.3</A> addresses the Help system in greater detail.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC29">Navigate
a path
</a></h5>
       
<IMG src="/img/help/4.9d.gif"><p>
The Path Navigator icon allows you to navigate a path. This icon is a square
maze with an arrow at either side, suggesting a meander through Perseus. The
meander has three active components: the left arrow, the meander center, and
the right arrow.<p>
The left and right arrows are Previous Stop and Next Stop along the Path,
respectively. Click them to go to the previous and next locations of the path
you are following. The meander center is a Record button which allows you to
add a location to the Path you are creating. <p>
Instructions on following a pre-recorded Path in Perseus are in <A HREF="ch3.html#3.2">chapter 3.2</A>.
For complete information on creating Paths, see <A HREF="ch10.html#10.2">chapter 10.2</A>
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC30">Go
to Perseus Gateway
</a></h5>
      
<IMG src="/img/help/4.9e.gif"><p>
The Gateway icon places you at the main access point of Perseus, the Perseus
Gateway. If you lose your bearings,  you can always return to your  starting
point. From the Gateway, you can select any element of Perseus.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC31">Go
to Previous Card and Go to Next Card
</a></h5>
       
<IMG src="/img/help/4.9f.gif">
     
<IMG src="/img/help/4.9g.gif"><p>
<p>
The left arrow on the Navigator takes you to the previous card in a stack,
moving you backward in a linear fashion. For example, if you are in the
Architecture stack and the current card is Olympia,Swimming Pool with Greek
Baths, the left arrow will take you to the previous card of that stack,
Olympia,Stadium. (Because of programming requirements, commas in a catalog
title are not followed by a space.)<p>
It is, therefore, not necessary to return to the Index level in order to
proceed through the cards of a stack.<p>
The right arrow on the Navigator takes you to the next card in a stack, moving
you forward in a linear progression. For example, if you are examining the
entry "Bell krater" in the Encyclopedia, the right arrow will take you to the
next catalog entry in the Encyclopedia, "Bellerophon."<p>
About Cards and Stacks: HyperCard organizes information electronically,
analogous to a number of note card stacks. The sculpture data, for example,  is
stored in the cards of one stack, the text of Sophocles in the cards of
another. The Go to Previous Card and Go to Next Card arrows take you to cards
within the current stack. The Go Back arrow takes you to a location in a
previous stack.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC32">Go
Back to last location
</a></h5>
       
<IMG src="/img/help/4.9h.gif"><p>
The Go Back (bent) arrow returns you to a<i> </i>card in a previous location -
most often to the stack you were in before you entered the current Perseus
resource. If you click the Go Back arrow several times in succession, you will
retrace your steps backward. This is not the same as the Go to Previous Card
arrow, described above. <p>
Please be aware of the limitations of the Go Back feature. Because Perseus is
large and complex, the Go Back feature does not always take you where you
expect. An alternate method of retracing one's steps is to use the Go Recent
feature of HyperCard. Choose <tt>Go Recent</tt> from the Go menu. A message
window appears with thumbnail images of the windows previously accessed in the
current HyperCard session. Click one of the thumbnails to return to that window.

AUTHOR/DRAWING CREDITS
</a></h3>
When a Perseus screen or image has been created specially by an artist or
photographer, the credit automatically appears in a floating window  along with
it. The floating window can be dragged across the desktop to any location and
can be closed by clicking the upper left-hand corner of the box.<p>
The display of credits is often a condition of the agreement negotiated with a
museum, artist or photographer to include a collection or work in Perseus.
Accordingly, there is no provision for turning off the author credits.

LINKS PULL-DOWN MENU
</a></h3>
The Links menu lists most of the Perseus resources that are available from the
Gateway and from the main indexes, such as the Art &amp; Archaeology Index and
the Tools &amp; References Index.<p>
Perseus resources have several different types of links. Links are implemented
through buttons, text, and the Links Menu (figure 4.8). Using the Links Menu,
you can move among the Perseus resources without returning to the Gateway. <p>
When you have selected text in any part of Perseus and you then use the Links
menu to go to a new resource, Perseus tries to look up the selected text in the
resource you have chosen from the Links menu.<p>

<a name="4.5.1">4.5.1
LOOKUP TOOL
</a></h4>
Lookup is a new tool in Perseus 2.0. The Lookup tool lets you make a global
query of the Perseus databases with a single word or phrase. It resolves words
or phrases into canonical Perseus references and associates conventional
Perseus names with alternate versions of names. (Canonical Perseus references
are the precise words or abbreviations used by the software program to locate
information across all of its resources.) Through this process, the Lookup tool
identifies the resources in Perseus where the selected topic may be found. The
Lookup tool also provides shortcuts for navigating the Perseus data base when
you know exactly the resource you want to see.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC36">Using
Lookup to Query Possible References
</a></h5>
The Lookup tool does not identify all the instances of a particular word or
phrase anywhere in the English text of Perseus - this task is performed by the
English Index tool, also found under the Links menu. Instead, when you type in
particular word or phrase, Lookup points you to the Perseus resources
containing the object or the attributes of the object of your query.<p>
If you want to search for all occurrences of a word or phrase anywhere in the
English text of Perseus, use the English Index. <p>
&gt;	Use Lookup to find the Perseus resources for the query "Castor and Pollux"
and to resolve this phrase into its canonical Perseus reference. <p>
Use whole words or phrases, not starting characters, as search strings in
Lookup. If you want to search by starting characters, use the English Index
instead. <p>
Open the Lookup tool by choosing it from<b> </b>the Links menu.  Type
<tt>Castor and Pollux</tt> into the Lookup tool and press return. <p>
You will see "dioskouroi" in the left column (figure 4.9). "Dioskouroi" is the
canonical Perseus reference derived from the query "Castor and Pollux;" the
names below the line are names associated with "Castor and Pollux" which Lookup
recognizes.<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/4.9.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 4.9 Lookup Tool.</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>The right column lists the resources in Perseus containing the canonical
reference "dioskouroi," which is found, accordingly, as a Keyword for Sculpture
and in the English Index. You can investigate each reference in turn by
clicking  one of the possible resources in the right column.<p>
If the Lookup tool begins to fail or behave erratically, close it and reopen it
from the Links menu.  <p>
&gt;	Use Lookup to undertake a more complex search, in which further canonical
Perseus references are given.<p>
Open the Lookup tool by choosing it from<b> </b>the Links menu.  Type
<tt>Hera</tt> into the Lookup tool and press return. Seventeen possible links
having to do with Hera appear in the left ("Could be") column (Figure 4.10).<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/4.10.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 4.10 Lookup with results of clicking  "charioteer" in left
column.</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>&gt;	Look for a connection between Hera and charioteer in Perseus vase
painting data.<p>
Click <tt>charioteer</tt>, the fifth below hera in the left column. A list of
Perseus resources appears in the right column. To go to an associated Perseus
resource, click a line in the right column. In this case, results for
<tt>charioteer</tt> appear in four resources: the Encyclopedia, as a Keyword in
the Vase, Coin and Sculpture Catalogs, in the English Index, and in the
English-Greek Word Search.<p>

<h5>
<a name="RTFToC37">Use
Lookup to Go Directly to a Known Primary Text Destination
</a></h5>
If you have a specific citation in the Primary Texts in mind, you can use the
Lookup tool for quickest access to it. Type in the canonical Perseus name or
abbreviation and press Return. This is a feature you will probably use only
after you have become familiar with Perseus and only if you frequently use the
same resources in Perseus.<p>
The direct Lookup feature does not apply to Perseus resources other than
Primary Texts.<p>
&gt;	Follow these steps to go to line 250 of Euripides's <i>Medea</i> .<p>
Choose Lookup from the Links menu. A small floating window appears. Type
<tt>Eur. Med. 250</tt> and press Return.<p>
NOTE: When you use the Lookup tool as a shortcut to Primary Texts, you must use
specific abbreviations and formats for author's name, work, and book, chapter,
section, or line reference. These are known as canonical Perseus references,
and a complete lists are found in the Appendix of this User's Guide and in
Online help under the topic  Canonical Abbreviations for Primary Texts.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC38">Use
Lookup to Go to a Known Resource 
</a></h5>
If you know specific catalog and article titles, you can use Lookup to go to it
quickly. This procedure involves an additional step to that with Primary Texts,
above.<p>
&gt;	Go to the card for the Doric Treasury at Delphi in the Architecture
Catalog.<p>
Choose Lookup from the Links menu. A small floating window appears. Type
<tt>Delphi,Doric Treasury</tt>, thus: Delphi,Doric Treasury,  and press return.
Do not leave any spaces between Delphi, the comma and Doric. Now click
Architecture Catalog in the right column.<p>
Note that when you use Lookup as a shortcut to a particular building, coin,
sculpture, site, or vase, you must use the exact title of the catalog entry,
and that there is an extra step of clicking the desired item in the right
column.

&gt;	Choose any resource or tool from the Links menu. <p>
Using the Links menu to go to Perseus Resources and Tools is a shortcut for
returning to the Gateway and clicking an icon.<p>
If you know the exact form of a Perseus Catalog title or Catalog number, you
can link with its card by selecting the text containing the reference, choosing
the appropriate Resource from the Links menu. Perseus will look up the selected
text in the resource you have chosen.<p>
&gt;	Link with the Sculpture Catalog card for Kleobis and Biton from the
Stewart essays on Greek sculpture.<p>
Go to the Essays by clicking the Essays icon on the Gateway choosing <tt>Essays
&amp; Catalogs</tt> from the Links menu. Click <tt>One Hundred Greek Sculptors:
Their Careers and Extant Works</tt>. A Table of Contents for the Stewart essays
appears. Click  <tt>4.2.4.2 Hageladas of Argos</tt>. Select <tt>Kleobis and
Biton</tt> from the second line of text. Choose <tt>Sculpture</tt> from the
Links menu. Perseus will take you to the Catalog card for Kleobis and Biton.<p>
This is an advanced technique, and will work only if the selected text is
identical to the Perseus Catalog card title or number.

PATH MENU ITEMS
</a></h4>
There are five items on the Perseus pull-down menu which operate Paths. The
following overview describes how to add a Location, or stop, to a Path, how to
see the current Path Card, how to see a Path Index, how to rejoin a Path, and
how to change a Path. For complete information about using Paths in Perseus,
see <A HREF="ch10.html">chapter 10</A>, Saving Your Work. Before you use Paths, you first must identify
the location of your Path stack on the hard disk by using the Settings feature
from the Gateway. This procedure is described in <A HREF="#4.2">4.2</A> above, and in greater
detail in <A HREF="ch10.html#10.5">chapter 10.5</A>.<p>
Any number of Paths may be stored in a personal Path stack. The card listing
the Paths kept in the stack is called the Path Index. The Current Path is that
Path presently loaded into Perseus, the one which you have chosen to follow.
The Current Path card contains a series of icons representing the various Stops
on the Path.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC54">Add
