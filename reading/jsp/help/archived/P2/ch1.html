<br><br><br>Perseus 2.0 is an electronic database on Archaic and Classical Greece that was
designed to expand the ways in which ancient Greek literature, history, art and
archaeology can be studied. This chapter of the User's Guide is intended to
provide a brief introduction to the expectations and motivations for using
Perseus, to show off new features built into Perseus, and to provide quick
access to Perseus 2.0 for experienced users of version 1.0. 
Newcomers to the Perseus environment will find all they need to know  about
equipment requirements and set-up in chapter 2 and using Online help and the
Guided Tours of Perseus in chapter 3. This Guide is intended as more of a
self-tutorial than a technical manual, and it is our hope that all users will
avail themselves of the many examples and illustrations herein.

<h3><A NAME="1.1">1.1 WHAT IS PERSEUS?</A></h3>
Perseus 2.0 represents the completion of a plan, first outlined in 1985, to
construct a large and heterogeneous database of materials -- textual and visual
-- illustrating the Archaic and Classical Greek world.  Primary support for
Perseus 2.0 has come from the <A HREF="http://www.learner.org/">Annenberg/CPB Projects</A> with additional support
from <A HREF="http://www.apple.com">Apple Computer</A>, <A HREF="http://inet.ed.gov/prog_info/FIPSE/index.html">the Fund for the Improvement of Post-Secondary Education</A>,
the <A HREF="http://www.getty.edu/getty.html">Getty Grant Program</A>, the <A HREF="http://artsedge.kennedy-center.org/db/nea/nea-home.html">National Endowment for the Arts</A>, the <A HREF="http://www.nsf.gov">National
Science Foundation</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.xerox.com">Xerox Corporation</A>.  Perseus is a collaborative
enterprise to which individuals from dozens of institutions have contributed
over the years.  Originally centered at <A HREF="http://www.harvard.edu">Harvard University</A>, The Perseus Project
moved to <A HREF="http://www.tufts.edu">Tufts University</A> in the fall of 1993.<p>
Scale in such an enterprise is important:  we knew that we could not, of
course, include every piece of primary evidence about ancient Greece, but what
we wanted to assemble was a "critical mass" of materials. We wanted the
database to have enough overall depth that it would support wide-ranging study
of many topics.  For the general student of ancient Greece, Perseus 2.0
constitutes a compact digital library with many key materials:  24,000 images,
with information on 1420 vases, 366 sculptures, 384 buildings, 179 sites, and
524 coins.  Perseus 2.0 holds two thirds of the surviving literature up to the
death of Alexander the Great in Greek with English translation, the
Liddell-Scott <i>Intermediate Greek English Lexicon</i>, a color Atlas of the
Greek World, articles on ancient authors and archaeology, an Overview of Greek
History from Homer to the death of Alexander the Great, and a 2600-entry
Bibliography.  Thus, Perseus contains a representative selection of primary
data and a substantial amount of secondary documentation; however, it was not
conceived as a replacement for the University library. Perseus 2.0 is, rather,
a tool which complements traditional resources, and it may be compared to a
book shelf stocked with standard texts and references, with the ability
inherent to the electronic medium to search and organize information quickly.
<HR>
<h3><A NAME="1.2">1.2 KEY GOALS</A></h3>
At the very beginning of our work, we made two strategic decisions about the
scope and design of this database.  First, we had initially considered
developing an "interactive curriculum" on ancient Greek culture -- something
like a unified book with a massive "appendix" of source materials.  Such an
approach would have had obvious advantages:  we could have chosen several
unifying themes and provided detailed materials on these, and such an
electronic book could be packaged for a very wide audience.  Students and
scholars alike would have derived benefits from the predictability and
homeogeneity of such a design.<p>
After considerable thought, however, we chose to build as general a tool as we
could rather than a resource that covered one or more topics of ancient Greece
in detail.  In part, our decision reflected the prejudices of faculty who told
us that they wanted better access to primary materials--texts, maps, pictures
of art objects, site plans, searching aids and other basic tools--so that they
could construct their own arguments and narratives.  At the same time, we
sensed that neatly packaged electronic books were premature:  all of us, in
every field, are still learning how best to use new interactive tools.  We
realized early on that no one really understood how electronic editions of
source texts should be designed or how catalogue entries for museum objects
should be organized so as to exploit the strengths of this new medium.  We
chose to concentrate on what we called already in 1986 the "infrastructure"
necessary to help people -- from elementary school students to scholars  --
explore the ancient Greek world in ways that were not feasible with print
tools.<p>
Second, we were also determined to build a database that would be accessible to
the widest possible audience.  It  would, in some ways, have been much easier
to build Perseus on a high-end workstation, but neither these high-end machines
nor the expensive software components that we would need were widely accessible
to our target audience.  While we hoped to construct something of interest to
computer scientists specializing in Hypertext systems, we wanted Perseus to
extend, not restrict, the audience for ancient Greek culture.  Our goal was to
create a database for a hardware platform that cost less than $3,000.  At
present, the cost of a system to run Perseus -- and run it well -- is now
between $1,500 and $2,000.  When in 1987 we began serious development, MS-DOS
dominated the PC world and the Macintosh was the only feasible platform for our
work.  HyperCard (which we first encountered in May 1987 as beta software
called WildCard), for all its limitations, provided a reasonable delivery
environment.  HyperCard is, however, slow, limited in its capabilities and,
worst of all, for all practical purposes restricted to the Macintosh
environment.  Perseus 2.0 is, in all probability, the last version of the
database that will use HyperCard.  Nevertheless, Hypercard has allowed us to
provide a wide range of features on a relatively inexpensive hardware
platform.<p>
Our primary challenge, perhaps, has been reconciling the emphasis on
infrastructure and the determination to reach the widest possible audience. The
majority of our efforts have gone into building a database that would not only
serve a broad audience immediately but that could also grow more useful over
time.  As a result, there is a sharp distinction between Perseus 2.0--the
monumental database that we can distribute inexpensively on CD-ROM (compact
disc read-only memory)--and the "real" Perseus database, which consists of many
applications and databases stored in a variety of formats, none of which is
tied to any one application or operating system.  <p>
All texts have, for example, been stored in a general purpose format called
SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) that can facilitate sophisticated
text analysis (e.g., compare the vocabularies of two different characters in a
play or search for poetry quoted by Plato).  HyperCard cannot, however, support
such work, and we have had to strip our texts of this SGML encoding before
publishing them.  <p>
Likewise, when we first began work assembling pictures, videodiscs were the
best medium for publishing images and the infrastructure needed to support
libraries of digital images was years away from our audience.  We chose,
however, to collect 35 mm slides, even though the film was vastly more
expensive than videotape. The slides, when transferred to video, did not
produce images as sharp as those based on 3/4 videotape.  Now, hoewever, as
videodiscs have begun to disappear and digital images are common, our digitized
slides are far clearer and more detailed than any video-based images could be,
and we can, in future years, redigitize these slides to provide images of even
greater quality.  If we had used video images rather than slides to produce the
best possible videodisc in 1992, we would have constructed a resource that was
obsolete in 1995.  The maps, linguistic databases and other elements of Perseus
each reflect self-standing projects that exploit or, in some cases, define
standards.  Perseus 2.0 is, in many ways, the tip of an iceberg.  Even if we
were not to add any more materials and were only to republish Perseus in newer
software packages, its functionality could increase dramatically over the years.
<HR>
<h3><A NAME="1.3">1.3 GENERAL READERS AND SPECIALISTS</A></h3>
While Perseus 2.0 has many things to offer a wide range of users, we have found
that most people tend to fall into one of two groups.  <p>
First, those who are not specialists in ancient Greek culture have, in working
with pre-release versions of Perseus 2.0, found it to be a handy and fairly
comprehensive environment within which to explore aspects of ancient Greece.
Thomas Martin's Overview of Classical Greek History has been expanded since
Perseus 1.0 and now contains more than two thousand new links to other
materials in the database.  The Overview was designed to provide a succinct
introduction both to many aspects of Greek history, literature, society and
culture and to the resources available generally in the database.<p>
Second, Perseus 2.0 is one prototype for a digital library, but it was designed
to augment, rather than replace, traditional tools.  Perseus 2.0 will offer to
specialists a useful compendium of many source materials, but the individual
pieces of Perseus 2.0 will probably be most useful for this group:  the
specialist will find in Perseus a series of interlinked individual tools, a
collection of "books" rather than a comprehensive library.  Already in Perseus
1.0, we were able to offer a number of tools which constituted an advance upon
what had previously been published.  The retrieval tools, for example, allowed
users to search the texts included in Perseus 1.0 in ways that no other system
allowed.  Similarly, Perseus 1.0 included a substantial body of original visual
materials commissioned by the project:  the 1,000 color pictures of 500 Greek
coins from the Dewing Collection, the 450 images of the Aegina Pediments in
Munich and the 111 views of the Harvard Cleophrades Crater, to take only three
examples, each could have constituted a separate publication that contributed
to the study of Greek art and archaeology.  Perseus 2.0 contains many more new
resources for the specialist.  The philological tools not only cover more
authors but have themselves been refined and expanded.  The coverage of art and
archaeology has grown enormously--Perseus 2.0 contains, for example,
information on more than ten times as many vases than did 1.0.  And where
Perseus 1.0 contained only outline maps of ancient Greece, Perseus 2.0 contains
roughly a thousand color satellite images and topographic maps.

<h3><A NAME="1.4">1.4 NEW FEATURES IN PERSEUS 2.0</A></h3>
New additions to Perseus 2.0 fall into the areas of textual, geographical and
object data on the one hand, and electronic enhancements on the other. As for
data, there is more of almost everything, with a completely new Atlas
containing c. 1,000 color maps derived from Satellite Data and the Digital
Chart of the World. The following new features have been built into the
software: <p>
-- Online help, keyed to the part of Perseus in which you are located<p>
-- Search tools for art and archaeology<p>
-- the Browser and Lookup, designed to make it easier to find out what is in
the databases<p>
-- the Search Saver, a means of storing and keeping at hand the results of an
operation<p>
-- new Philological tools which place at your disposal an advanced and
sophisticated means of searching both Greek and English texts, and processing
and organizing philological data.<p>
<p>
With the exception of the Atlas (which has been completely rebuilt), no aspect
of the Perseus database has grown more dramatically than our collection of
vases.  Perseus 2.0 contains 1,420 vases illustrated with more than 14,500
images.  A grant from the NEA allowed us to commission six essays by leading
experts in the field which introduce the styles of major Greek Vase Painters as
well as the collection of vases included in Perseus 2.0.  These essays which
total c. 40,000 words (roughly 160 pages of double spaced typescript) contain
specific links to 428 separate illustrations, many of them new photographs
taken by Maria Daniels, the Perseus Project Photographer.

<h3><A NAME="1.5">1.5 QUICK ENTRY FOR PERSEUS 1.0 USERS</A></h3>
The basic operation of Perseus and its interface are substantially the same.
Users of Perseus 1.0 will want to turn to the installation and startup
procedure, which has been greatly simplified (<A HREF="ch2.html#2.3">section 2.3</A>). New Guided Tours
and Paths (<A HREF="ch3.html#3.2">section 3.2</A>) highlight the new features built into Perseus. Online
help is available anywhere in Perseus  by clicking the "?" icon on the
Navigator Palette - this feature is described in section 3.3.<p>
Of particular interest will be chapters in this Guide devoted to Search Tools
(<A HREF="ch5.html">chapter 5</A>), the Atlas (<A HREF="ch7.html">chapter 7</A>), and Philological tools (<A HREF="ch8b.html">chapter 8, part 2</A>).<p>
Two issues in upgrading versions are covered, Converting Paths from Version 1.0
to 2.0 (<A HREF="ch10.html#10.2.8">section 10.2.8</A>) and the CD Swapper (<A HREF="ch10.html#10.4">section 10.4</A>) built to accommodate
this multi-cd version of Perseus.
<HR>
<h3><A NAME="1.6">1.6 THE CONCISE EDITION OF PERSEUS 2.0</A></h3>
Yale University Press has published Perseus 2.0 in two editions, the
Comprehensive Edition and the Concise Edition. The former is a four cd-rom set,
and the latter is a single cd-rom. The Concise Edition corresponds to Perseus
Disc 1 and contains all texts, tools, utilities and thumbnail images that are
in the Full Edition. Thus, the Concise Edition has the same textual contents,
capabilities and features as the Comprehensive Edition. It lacks most of the
full-screen images.<p>
Full-screen images in the Concise Edition include all pictures linked to the
Historical Overview, to the Encyclopedia, to the Essays, to vases from Boston
Museum of Fine Arts cataloged by Caskey and Beazley, to over 900
site/architecture images from the Large Site Plans and to the Paths that are
distributed with Perseus 2.0. In addition, all of the approximately 3600
sculpture images have been included. This brings the total to approximately
6100 full-screen images in the Concise Perseus.<p>
These images are kept in five folders called Unversal Images on the Perseus CD.
To get a sense of what is there, you can browse through them with the Slide
Shower (described in <A HREF="ch4.html#4.6.5">section 4.6.5</A>).<p>

<h3><A NAME="1.7">1.7 FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS</A></h3>
Perseus continues to develop on a number of fronts:<p>
<b><A HREF="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/Dev/PerseusTk.html">Perseus for Windows</A></b>:  Support from the Annenberg/CPB Projects has
allowed us to begin work on a new platform-independent version of Perseus that
will run both on the Macintosh and under the Windows operating system.<p>
<b>Perseus on the World Wide Web</b>:  Perhaps the most exciting development in
recent years has been the rise of the Internet.  We have established a Perseus
World Wide Web site (<A HREF="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu">http://www.perseus.tufts.edu</A>), which contains a variety of
useful tools and the latest developments in Perseus.  The Web site includes
copies of documentation, a growing body of source materials (some of which are
not in Perseus 2.0), reports on the actual use of Perseus in teaching and
research, links to other relevant sites (such as the Perseus Atlas Project at
Holy Cross) and various other services.<p>
<b><A HREF="http://perseus.holycross.edu">Perseus Atlas Project</A></b>:  The maps available in Perseus 2.0 were developed
by Professor D. Neel Smith of Holy Cross.  His work on using state-of-the-art
"Geographic Information Systems" tools and datasets such as the satellite
imagery and the Digital Chart of the World continues.  One goal of the Perseus
Atlas Project is to create an online service whereby this material could be
accessed and analyzed directly over the Net.<p>
<b><A HREF="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/FIPSE/">Evaluation of Perseus in Teaching and Learning</A></b>:  A grant from the Fund
to Improve Post-Secondary Education has allowed us to study the impact of
Perseus on teaching and learning at more than a dozen institutions.  Results
from this can be found on the World Wide Web Site.<b></b><p>
<b><A HREF="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/lexindex">The Electronic Liddell-Scott-Jones Greek Lexicon</A></b>:  Grants from the
National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Science Foundation have
made it possible for us to begin creating an electronic version of the standard
Greek lexicon as well as other more specialized lexicographic tools.<p>
<b>Ancient Science</b>:  Support from the National Science Foundation has
allowed us to begin work on materials central to the history science.  This
support will allow us to offer a complete version of Aristotle as well as of
other key texts (such as <A HREF="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/text?lookup=euc.+elem.+1.1">Euclid's <i>Elements</i></A>).<p>
