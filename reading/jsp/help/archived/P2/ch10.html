Several specialized stacks and utilities allow you to customize your use of
Perseus. Use the Paths utility to create and follow paths through Perseus. The
Notebook utility records your notes and searches or annotates Perseus resources
for others. Current Assignment is a personal stack in which Perseus
assignments, messages of the day or other information for a group of users can
be posted. The CD Swapper is also a personal stack; it stores a number of image
requests until you are ready to swap the current cd-rom. The four utilities
above are found under the Perseus menu. Perseus Settings (overview in <A HREF="ch4.html#4.2.3">chapter
4.2.3</A>, described in detail below), and Atlas Settings (described in <A HREF="ch7.html#7.2.3">chapter
7.2.3</A>) are reached from the Settings icon on the Gateway. Atlas Settings are
also reached from the Atlas menu. You may configure the display Primary Texts,
both Greek and English, using the controls on the Utility Bar and the Text Menu
within Primary Texts (described in <A HREF="ch8.html#8.2">chapter 8.2</A> and <A HREF="ch8.html#8.3">8.3</A>).

<h3><a name="10.1">10.1 PERSONALIZING STACKS</a></h3>
Certain stacks may be duplicated and renamed for your personal use. These are
Path, Notebook and CD Swapper stacks. To duplicate a stack, go to the Finder,
select a stack by single-clicking it, choose the item <tt>Duplicate</tt> under
the File menu. Rename the stack as you would any Macintosh file. We suggest a
name identifying stack function and user (if there are several who share a
workstation), for example, "Elli's Paths," "Hdt. Notebook." Instructions for
loading personalized stacks into Perseus are given in the section on Settings
below. New Notebook and CD Swapper stacks will be blank. You must delete the
factory-installed Paths from a new Path  stack.<p>
A stack cannot be duplicated while it is active, i.e., currently in use by
Perseus.
<HR><h3><a name="10.2">10.2 PATHS</a></h3>
A path is a sequence of Locations in Perseus. Any Perseus card or selection on
a Perseus card can be considered a Location. A Path card (figure 10.1) shows
all the locations in a given path, in sequential order, reading from left to
right; the first Location is in the upper left-hand corner of the card, the
last in the lower right. Each Path Location is represented by an icon
indicating the Perseus resource in which that Location is found. In figure 10.1
the vase icon indicates that the objects are in the Perseus vase collection.<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/10.1.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 10.1 A Path card.</b></CENTER>
<h4>
<a name="10.2.1">10.2.1
CURRENT PATH STACK</a></h4>
A Path stack is made up of a Path Index and a number of Path cards. The Perseus
Path stack is designed so that each user can create and save new paths as well
as follow previously created paths. You can keep any number of Path stacks in
the Perseus folder on your hard disk. Path stacks may contain the Paths
originally distributed with Perseus 2.0 or Paths created by yourself and
others.<p>
It is essential that the Path stacks be on your hard drive, not the cd-rom, in
order for any changes to be recorded.<p>
The current Path stack is the one in effect during your Perseus session. To
choose the current Path stack, go to the Gateway and click the Settings icon.
The Settings card will appear (figure 10.2).<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/10.2.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 10.2 Settings card.</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>Click the <tt>Path Stack</tt> button. <p>
If there is no current Path stack, it will be blank; it will display the
current Path stack if one was chosen in a previous Perseus session. Figure 10.2
shows a current stack Paths in a folder Local Stacks in a folder Perseus 2.0 in
the hard disk Elli's Hard Disk. The Path stack which you select under Settings
will remain the current Path stack until you change it through the Settings
utility. <p>
When you click the <tt>Path Stack</tt> button, a file dialog window appears
(figure 10.3).<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/10.3.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 10.3 Path Settings file dialog window.</b>
</CENTER><p><b></b>Open the file containing the desired Path stack, select the desired
stack, click <tt>Open</tt>, and this choice will remain the current Path stack
until another one is chosen.<p>
The stack simply named "Paths" contains the Guided Tours and other Paths that
are distributed with Perseus 2.0.<p>
We suggest that if you wish to follow a Path submitted on a floppy disk, you
first copy it to your Local Stacks folder.
<h4><a name="10.2.2">10.2.2 PATH INDEX </a></h4>
The Path Index (figure 10.4) lists the names of all the paths in your current
Path stack. To go to the Path Index, click the Paths icon on the Gateway. Or
from anywhere within Perseus, choose the item Path Index from the Perseus menu.
You can choose a Path to follow from this Index. You can also create new Paths,
edit a Path, or import Paths from another Path stack.<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/10.4.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 10.4 Path Index listing the ready-made Paths distributed with Perseus
2.0.</b><p>
</CENTER><b></b>To start following a Path, double-click it.<p>
The buttons at the upper right-hand corner of the Path Index provide four
utilities: <tt>Follow Path, Edit Path</tt> and <tt>New Path </tt>and<tt> Import
Path</tt>.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC6">Follow
Path
</a></h5>
Click a Path once to select it, then click the button <tt>Follow Path</tt>.
Perseus will take you to the beginning of the Path. More detailed instructions
are given in Follow a Path below.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC7">Edit
Path
</a></h5>
Click a Path once  to select it.  Click <tt>Edit Path</tt>. Perseus will take
you to the current Path card, from which you can arrange, edit and annotate the
Path. See Path Card below.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC8">New
Path
</a></h5>
Click <tt>New Path</tt>. You should now be looking at a new Path card whose
name is Path, followed by the time and date the new card was created. If a Path
name was selected when you clicked this button, the selection will be ignored.
You can change the name to indicate its contents simply by typing a new name.
See Create a Path below.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC9">Import
Path
</a></h5>
To import a Path from another Path stack to the current Path stack, click the
button <tt>Import Path</tt> on the Path Index, upper right. A dialog window
appears asking you what Path stack you wish to import from. Select the stack
and click <tt>Open</tt>. A new dialog window appears asking you what Path you
wish to import. Select the desired Path and click <tt>OK</tt>. If you decide
not to import a Path, click <tt>Cancel</tt>. Perseus will display the newly
imported Path card. Click <tt>Path Index</tt> to return to the Path Index.<p>
Do not follow the above procedure to import Paths from Perseus 1.0. Conversion
of version 1.0 Paths is described in <A HREF="#10.2.7">section 10.2.7</A>.
<h4><a name="10.2.3">10.2.3
FOLLOW A PATH
</a></h4>
From the Perseus Gateway, you are always three clicks from the start of a Path.
Click the Paths icon to bring up the Path Index. Select the Path you wish to
follow by clicking it once. Click the button <tt>Follow Path</tt>.
(Alternatively, you may double-click the Path you wish to follow.) Detailed
instructions are given below.<p>
Choose a Path to follow from the Path Index. (To go to the Path Index, click
the Paths icon on the Gateway or choose the item Path Index from the Perseus
menu.) Select a Path and click the button <tt>Follow Path</tt> (or double-click
the Path you wish to follow). Perseus will take you to the first Location on
the Path. <p>
The control used to go forward and backward along a Path, and to create new
Locations on the Path, is the Path Navigator on the Navigator Palette. The
active points on the Path Navigator icon are depicted below (figure 10.5). <p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/10.5.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 10.5  Path Navigator icon.</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>If you are currently walking a Path, you can move forward and back on it
using the arrows on the Path Navigator icon. You can also add a Location to a
Path by clicking the center of the meander on the Path Navigator. Further
details on adding Locations are in Create a Path, below. <p>
When you are walking a Path, click the right arrow on the Path Navigator icon
to go to the next Path Location. Click the left arrow on the Path Navigator
icon to go to the previous Path location.<p>
As you follow a Path, you may wish to investigate something that causes you to
leave your Location on the Path. If you decide to add the new Location to the
path, follow the instructions below. If you wish to return to the Path, choose
<tt>Current Path Location</tt> from the Perseus menu. If you wish to continue
on the Path, click the right arrow on the Path Navigator to go to the next
Location.<p>
Feel free to leave the Path at any time to explore the Perseus environment on
your own. To rejoin the Path where you left it, choose <tt>Current Path
Location</tt> from the Perseus menu. However, if you quit Perseus, you must
again choose a Path to follow according to the instructions in this section.
<h4>
<a name="10.2.4">10.2.4
CREATE A PATH</a></h4>
You can create your own Paths by setting up and naming a new Path card, then
adding Locations to the Path from anywhere within Perseus with the Path
Navigator.<p>
To create a Path, go to the Path Index by clicking the Paths icon on the
Gateway (or from anywhere within Perseus, choose the item Path Index from the
Perseus menu.)<p>
The Path Index appears (figure 10.4). Click the button <tt>New Path</tt>, upper
right.<p>
A blank Path card appears (figure 10.6). <p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/10.6.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 10.6 New Path card.</b><p>
</CENTER><b></b>Give your Path a new name by typing it into the field, upper left. Your
new Path card becomes the current Path and is now listed in the Path Index. <p>
As you travel around in Perseus, you can add Locations to your Path by clicking
the center of the Path Navigator icon. In response, a dialog box appears asking
you to select a Path (figure 10.7).<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/10.7.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 10.7 Dialog window to add Location to Path.</b><p>
</CENTER><b></b>By default the current Path has been selected, but you can add the
Location to any other Paths on the Path Index by selecting one and clicking
<tt>OK</tt>. You may add up to 27 Locations to your Path.<p>

letters or less and contains no commas or double quotes. <p>
Please read the section "Path Card" below to find out how to edit and annotate
your Path.<p>
Almost every location in Perseus can be made into a Path Location  except the
Thumbnail Browser, the Sources Used Index and the Tools and References Index.
<h4>
<a name="10.2.5">10.2.5
PATH CARD
</a></h4>
Paths are stored and edited on a Path card. To edit your Path, you may rename,
delete, annotate, and rearrange path locations.<p>
A typical Path card is depicted below (figure 10.9). Each Path card can contain
up to twenty-seven locations. The locations are shown by icons indicating the
Perseus resource in which they are located--for example, Primary Texts and the
Atlas. A note describing the Path may be added, lower left, and notes for each
stop may be added, lower right.<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/10.9.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 10.9  Path card</b><p>
</CENTER><b></b>The three buttons in the upper right affect the Path card, and the three
buttons middle right affect the Path Stops.

To return to the Path Index, click the button <tt>Path Index</tt>.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC14">Delete
Path
</a></h5>
Click <tt>Delete Path</tt>. <p>
A dialog box appears requesting you to confirm the deletion of this path.<p>
Click <tt>Delete</tt> if you wish to delete the path. If you have changed your
mind or made a mistake, click <tt>Don't Delete</tt>. <p>
There is a protection mechanism in Perseus that prevents you from deleting a
path if it is the only remaining path left in the current stack. If you attempt
to delete this path, a dialog box appears with the message "Can't delete last
card of protected background."  
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC15">New
Path
</a></h5>
Click New Path. You should now be looking at a new card whose name is Path,
followed by the time and date this card was created. <p>
The name of the Path is selected when you first see the card. You can change
the name to indicate its contents simply by typing a new name. 
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC16">Rename</a></h5>
The button <tt>Rename</tt> allows you to change the name of a location. Click a
location icon to select it. Click <tt>Rename</tt>. A dialog box appears asking
you to enter a new name for the location. Type the new name for this location
and click <tt>OK</tt>.<p>
The Rename feature is available only when Rearrange mode (below) is off.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC17">Delete</a></h5>
<tt>Delete</tt> allows you to delete a location. Click a Location icon to
select it. Click <tt>Delete</tt>. A dialog box appears asking you to confirm
the deletion of the Location. Click <tt>Delete</tt> if you wish to delete it.
If you have changed your mind, click <tt>Don't Delete</tt>.<p>
The Delete feature is available only when Rearrange mode (below) is off.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC18">Go
There
</a></h5>
Go There allows you to go directly to a Location. Click a Location icon to
select it. Click <tt>Go There</tt>. You should now be at the Perseus card for
the selected location.<p>
The Go There feature is available only when Rearrange mode (below) is off.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC19">Rearrange</a></h5>
After you create a number of Locations, you may wish to rearrange them in a
different order on the Path card. You can change the order of your locations by
rearranging their icons on the Path card. <p>
Click the button <tt>Rearrange</tt>, middle left, to put the Path card into
Rearrange mode. An X appears in the check box next to <tt>Rearrange</tt>, and
the three buttons to the right--<tt>Rename, Delete, Go There</tt>--disappear.
In Rearrange mode, each Location icon can be dragged around the Path card. <p>
Drag the locations into a new arrangement just as you would drag any Macintosh
icon. <p>
You do not have to drag the icons to the exact positions where you want them to
end up. Positions are relative. If you drag an icon below or to the left of the
rest of the icons, it becomes the last one. When you leave Rearrange mode, the
icons realign.<p>
Click <tt>Rearrange</tt> a second time to save the locations in the new
arrangement. The check box no longer has an X in it.<p>
You must finish rearranging by clicking <tt>Rearrange</tt> to deselect it
before you can do anything else to the Path. If you decide to leave the Path
card or perform other functions, the Path card will take a minute to finish the
rearrangement automatically, displaying a dialog box with the message "Have to
finish rearranging."
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC20">Change
the Path Name
</a></h5>
Highlight the name of the path in the field at the top of the card, and type in
a new name to change the Path name.<p>
Names may not exceed twenty-four characters. Paths can also be renamed from the
Path Index.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC21">Annotate
the Path Card
</a></h5>
<h6>
<a name="RTFToC22">About
this Path 
</a></h6>
The text in the "About this Path" field in the lower left of the Path card can
be annotated with comments that are relevant to the entire path.<p>
Click the <tt>About this Path</tt> field to make the insertion point appear.<p>
Type comments or instructions into the box.
<h6>
<a name="RTFToC23">Individual
location annotations
</a></h6>
A note is attached to each location in a path. The annotation box at the lower
right-hand corner of the Path card allows you to annotate individual locations.
When you first open a Path card, this field is titled "No Notes" and is empty.
<p>
When you click a location, the title of this field changes to <tt>Notes
For</tt>, followed by the name of the selected location. Any pre-existing notes
for that location appear in the field. <p>
The annotations for a location also appear when you are following a path. When
you arrive at a location, its note appears in a floating window that can be
closed or repositioned on the screen.<p>
You may create or edit the annotation for a location by typing in the Notes
field at the lower right-hand corner of the card, or by editing the annotation
when it appears in a floating window as you are following a path. Be careful
not to edit the first line of the annotation, which has the path name and
location number.<p>
You can copy and paste annotations into the Path Note field or window from a
word processing application outseide of HyperCard. Be aware, however, that any
text formatting (tabs, italics, etc.) will be lost, and that the note will show
up as plain text in Perseus.

  PATH CONVERSION PERSEUS 1.0 TO VERSION 2.0
</a></h4>
Paths created with Perseus 1.0 must be converted in order to be compatible with
version 2.0.<p>
In order to effect the conversion, your copies of both Perseus 1.0 and
HyperCard 2.0 or better must be properly installed on your computer. Please see
the documentation for Perseus 1.0.<p>
Copy the folder Path Converter from Perseus 2.0 Disk 1 cd-rom to your hard
disk. You may find it convenient to copy the Path Converter folder into the
Perseus 1.0 Install Me folder. <p>
Quit from Perseus 2.0, if you have it running, load the Perseus 1 cd-rom and
launch Perseus 1.0 by double-clicking the version 1.0 Gateway.<p>
You will now be opening a new HyperCard stack from the Perseus 1.0 Gateway.
Choose the item <tt>Open Stack</tt> from the File menu. A file dialog window

convert, for example, Kewords in the Browser.
<HR><h3><a name="10.3">10.3 NOTEBOOK
</a></h3>
The Notebook is a HyperCard stack for taking notes while browsing through
Perseus. It also can be used to store the results of searches that you have
saved temporarily in the Search Saver. Data you store in a Notebook stack will
be saved from session to session of Perseus. We suggest that you copy and paste
your material into a word processing application in order to format, edit and
print it. Anything written with the Greek font will be changed to a Roman font
in the transition; you must have GreekKeys installed in your system in order to
restore the properly accented Greek characters.<p>
Please read <A HREF="#10.1">section 10.1</A> for directions on personalizing your Notebook stack.
<p>
The Notebook stack consists of a Notebook Index that lists the several Note
cards in that Notebook. Like any other Perseus card, Note cards can be added to
a Path. 
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC32">10.3.1
NOTEBOOK INDEX 
</a></h4>
To go to the Notebook Index (figure 10.14), choose the item <tt>Notebook</tt>

The Notebook Index contains a list of the names of all Note cards in your
Notebook stack. You can see all your Note cards from this Index. Figure 10.14
shows the Note card distributed with Perseus 2.0.<p>
From the Notebook Index, you can create new notes, rename notes, or delete
notes. The buttons at the upper right-hand corner of the Notebook Index provide

THE CD SWAPPER
</a></h3>
Because the thousands of images take up a great deal of space, it has been
necessary to publish the Perseus Comprehensive Edition on four cd-roms. When
you use Perseus from a cd-rom drive and request an image, text or map to be
displayed, it may not be on the current cd-rom. Perseus offers you the choice
of swapping the current cd-rom with the one that has the requested image,
canceling the request, or storing the request until a more convenient time. The
CD Swapper is the utility with which image requests are stored (figure
10.18).<p>
If you will  be swapping cd-roms, please be sure to turn off File Sharing in
the Control Panels of your Macintosh. Otherwise the Mac will not eject the
cd.<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/10.18.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 10.18 The CD Swapper</b><p>
</CENTER><b></b>Approximately 2500 images are common to all four cd-roms. These
so-called Universal Images include all images from the Museum of Fine Arts,
Boston, the Encylopedia, the Vase Painter Essays, Large Site Plans and the
Historical Overview. However, other resources reside on particular discs.
Primary Texts, the Atlas, and full-size Sculpture images (except the Olympia
Sculpture) live on Perseus Disk 1; Olympia Sculpture and full-size Architecture
and Site images live on Disk 2; full-size Vase images from collections listed
in the Perseus Vase Index under A-M live on Disk 3; full-size Vase images from
collections listed in the Perseus Vase Index under N-Z and Coins live on Disk
4. All else (Universal Images, Catalogs and Site plans, Essays, the
Encyclopedia, Sources Used, Thumbnail images, the Browser, and the English
Index) is common to all four disks.<p>
Thus, for example, if you are looking a a vase from the Yale University Art
Gallery on Disk 3, you must swap cd-roms if you want to link with the text of
the <i>Odyssey</i> on Disk 1. Alternatively, you may choose to store or cancel
your request.<p>
With the CD Swapper, requests are stored and recalled by disc number. For
example, if Perseus Disk 1 is currently in the cd-rom drive, and you have
stored a number of image requests in the CD Swapper stack, you can open the CD
Swapper at a convenient time to recall the image requests and insert the
appropriate cd-rom.<p>
The CD Swapper stack, like the Paths and Notebook stacks, is a stack that can
be privately maintained by the user, an advantage in a setting where Perseus is
shared with other users. By maintaining your own CD Swapper stack, you can
store and recall image requests during different work sessions without mixing
up your requests with those of other Perseus users.<p>
Owners of the Concise Edition of Perseus 2.0 will still be prompted by the CD
Swapper dialog box if the requested image is not on disc. If you have access to
the Comprehensive Edition at the University (for example), you can bring your
CD Swapper stack in on a floppy disk for later research.<p>
The images on the cd-roms are organized in folders according to image numbers.
Each folder has a set of related images. See the Appendix for the contents of
the folders.<p>
NOTE: If you are using Perseus on a network or  have stored all of Perseus on a
gigabyte hard drive, the CD Swapper will not be necessary because all images
will be available. 
<h4>
<a name=10.4.1">10.4.1
SWAPPING CD-ROMS
</a></h4>
When you request an image that is not on the current cd-rom, you see a dialog
box that asks whether you want to swap cd-roms now, cancel the request, or
store the request (figure 10.19).<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/10.19.gif"><p>
<b> 	Figure 10.19  CD Swapper dialog box.</b><p></CENTER>
<b></b>The dialog box shows a thumbnail of the requested image and indicates
the cd-rom on which the full image is located.<p>
If you choose to swap cd-roms now, the current cd-rom will be ejected from the
drive. You must insert the appropriate cd-rom in the drive, then click the item
you desire to link with fromthe list of requests in the CD Swapper.
<h4>
<a name="10.4.2">10.4.2
STORING AND RECALLING REQUESTS
</a></h4>
If you choose to store the request for an image that is not on the current
cd-rom, the image number and a brief description will be stored in a list in
the CD Swapper stack (figure 10.18). <p>
To find a stored image request for an offline cd-rom, you must previously have
stored an image request: with Disk 1 in the cd-rom drive, release the mouse on
the item Vases under the Links menu. Bring up the Vase Index by Collection.
Click B<tt>erlin,Antikenmuseen</tt>. Click <tt>Berlin F 1090</tt> on the right.
Select an image from the Vase Catalog card, and the CD Swapper dialog window
will appear. Click <tt>Store Request</tt>.<p>
Open the CD Swapper by choosing it from the Perseus menu. Perseus will ask you
to choose the current CD Swapper stack.<p>
The four discs are listed at left. At right is a list of stored image requests
for one of the cd-roms. <p>
Each cd-rom shows a status of being offline or online. There are also three
buttons, <tt>Eject Disk, Show List</tt>, and <tt>Clear List</tt>. <tt>Eject
Disk</tt> causes the appropriate cd-rom to eject from the drive. <tt>Show
List</tt> displays the list of stored image requests for the selected cd-rom.
<tt>Clear List </tt>deletes the stored image requests for the selected
cd-rom.<p>
Click a line in the list of image requests. You will be asked to insert the
appropriate disk. Once you do so, the image will appear.<p>
You can personalize your CD Swapper stack by duplicating and renaming it. We
suggest that you name the stack appropriately, for example, Elli's CD Swapper.

 SETTINGS
</a></h3>
<IMG src="/img/help/10.20a.gif"><p>
Detailed configuration settings are accessible from the main Settings utility,
reached by clicking the Settings icon on the Perseus Gateway. The Settings
utility enables you to choose which stack Perseus will use as the current Path
stack, Notebook stack or CD Swapper stack. The Settings utility offers a choice
of using video images from the videodisc and/or digital images from the cd-rom
volumes. You can use one or both types of images, if your hardware
configuration includes a videodisc player. Settings also lets you identify the
videodisc player in your configuration.<p>
If you will be using the digitized cd-rom images, it is no longer necessary to
use the Settings utility when you first install Perseus. The Path stack,
Notebook stack and CD Swapper stack distributed with Perseus 2.0 are by default
the current stack on startup, and they will remain so until you change them.
The configurations offered by the Settings utility dealing with images are, for
the most part, optional. You must change the current Settings only if you wish
to change the configuration of your computer and monitor.<p>
The Perseus Gateway is an unlocked stack (a locked stack is indicated by a
small lock icon at the far right of the menu bar). Therefore, any user may
change the Settings. A troubleshooting tip is to check the Settings if you
share the Gateway with other users.

PATH, NOTEBOOK AND CD SWAPPER SETTINGS
</a></h4>
Click the Settings icon on the Perseus Gateway. The Perseus Settings Card
appears (figure 10.20).<p>
<CENTER><IMG src="/img/help/10.20.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 10.20  Perseus Settings Card</b><p>
</CENTER><b></b>You can customize your configuration by establishing specific locations
for user Paths and user Notebooks. (The Notebook and Path utilities are
described previously in this chapter.)<p>
In figure 10.20, the Path Stack specification instructs Perseus to look for the
Path stack <tt>Paths</tt> in the folder <tt>Local Stacks</tt> on <tt>Elli's
Hard Disk</tt>. Similar specifications obtain for the Notebook Stack and the CD
Swapper stack. <p>
When you first install Perseus, the default Path and Notebook and CD Swapper
stacks are those distributed with the Perseus cd.<p>
&gt;	Change Path Stack<p>
Click the box to the right of <tt>Path Stack</tt>. A directory dialog box
appears for you to identify the file location of the Path stack you wish to
make current. Select the desired stack and click <tt>Open</tt>. Repeat the
procedure to change the Notebook and CD Swapper stacks.  <p>
You may wish to copy and rename the Path, Notebook and CD Swapper stacks to
create custom stacks. By renaming these stacks, you can distinguish your Paths
and Notebooks from those of other users. If several people are using Perseus at
one time, a stack being used by more than one person cannot be changed. Being
able to change and annotate the Path and Notebook stacks is very important if
you use these features. Copy and rename these stacks as part of your software
installation (do this on the Macintosh desktop).
<h4>
<a name="10.5.2">10.5.2
CHOOSE IMAGE TYPE
</a></h4>
Perseus offers two types of photographic images. One set of images has been
digitized from the Perseus slide archive and stored on the Perseus cd-rom
volumes. The digitized images are compressed 24-bit images that can be
displayed on 24-bit, 16-bit, and 8-bit color monitors. The other set of images
is on the Perseus videodisc. These require the use of a videodisc player
controlled by the Macintosh. See chapter 2, "Setup," for more information on
hardware requirements for images.<p>
You may use the videodisc images, the digitized images, or both sources. You
must turn on the setting to use videodisc images before you can activate the
pop-up menu for player type.<p>
To load the appropriate settings for your videodisc player, choose one of the
player names from the pop-up menu <tt>Select Player Type</tt>.<p>
If no videodisc player is connected to the Macintosh, the pop-up menu will be
inactive.<p>
Perseus 2.0 supports the following videodisc players: Hitachi 9550, Pioneer
4200, Pioneer 6000A, Pioneer 6010A, Sony LDP 1200, Sony 1500, Sony 2000. The
name of the player selected appears on the pop-up menu. <p>
The setting below Use Digital Images is a selection for Indexed Color. Digital
images are displayed according to the capacity of your monitor and the settings
in the Monitor Control Panel (in the Apple menu). Although Perseus images are
24-bit images, they can be displayed in 8-bit color through the application of
a color look-up table (CLUT), or an index of 256 colors that best represent the
image in an 8-bit environment. The default setting is to have indexed color on,
regardless of the color depth of your monitor. The ability to turn indexed
color off simply anticipates future advances in color display technology.
<h4>
<a name="10.5.3">10.5.3
WINDOW CONTROL
</a></h4>
Perseus can be set up to open to cards in a new window or open to cards in the
current window. Going to cards in a new window means that when you bring up a
new card, your previous location in Perseus remains on the screen in a
background window. You can progressively layer windows on the screen, but if
you exceed the number of open windows allowed by your system's memory, a dialog
box will advise you to close some of the windows. <p>
Going to cards in the same window means that your previous location in Perseus
is replaced by the card of the new location. No layering of windows occurs.<p>
Either setting can be temporarily reversed by pressing the Shift key while
clicking the mouse or choosing a menu item. For example, as you read a primary
text you may wish to analyze a word while keeping your primary text location in
a background window. If the setting is to go to cards in the same window, press
the Shift key when you click <tt>Analyze</tt>, and the Morphological Analysis
of the selected word will appear in a new window.

DETAILED CONFIGURATION
</a></h4>
The Perseus Gateway stack contains eight cards. These are:<p>
Card 1 - Gateway<p>
Card 2 - Atlas Settings. Use to save changes in the Atlas configuration.<p>
Card 3 - Main Settings. Covered above.<p>
Card 4 - Perseus Movie Settings. Covered below.<p>
Card 5 - Perseus Link Database. Do not change.<p>
Card 6 - Perseus Database. For customized installations.<p>
Card 7 - Perseus State of the World. Do not change.<p>
Card 8 - Known bugs. Bugs known to be in this version due to software
problems.<p>
From the Gateway, click the Forward and Backward arrows on the Navigator
Palette to go to these cards.<p>
Perseus will not operate with the Gateway stack locked. Thus, the data on these
cards is not tamper-proof. If any of the data is lost, you can always copy a
new Gateway stack from the Local Stacks folder on Perseus Disk 1.

CURRENT ASSIGNMENT
</a></h3>
You may find it useful to create a new HyperCard stack named <tt>Current
Assignment</tt> on which to post class assignments, messages of the day or
other information useful to a group of users.<p>
You can name any stack in the Local Stacks folder <tt>Current Assignment</tt>
and on the next startup of Perseus, that stack will appear as an item in the
Perseus menu. If there is no stack which you have named <tt>Current
Assignment</tt>, no such item will appear in the menu.<p>
Because the user level under the Perseus Player is set to 4, you cannot create
a new stack unless you do it under the HyperCard application set at user level
5. You can always rename any already-existing stack <tt>Current Assignment</tt>
under the Finder.<p>
You can make your Current Assignment stack somewhat tamper- (though not
hacker-) resistant by locking the stack from the Get Info box in the Finder.
When the stack is locked, its cards are read-only and cannot be deleted.<p><p><p> <p><A HREF="ch8.html"><IMG ALIGN=Left src="/img/help/la.gif" WIDTH=75 BORDER=3 ALT="Go Back"></A><br>
