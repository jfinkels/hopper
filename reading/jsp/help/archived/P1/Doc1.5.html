CHAPTER 5: ART &amp; ARCHAEOLOGY</h2>
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.51.gif"><p>
Perseus contains information, illustrations, and images about the art and
archaeology of ancient Greece. The Art &amp; Archaeology resource is the main
repository for this information, although relevant entries are also found in
the Encyclopedia and other resources in Perseus. Information is contained in
five catalogs:  Sites, Architecture, Sculpture, Pottery, and Coins. Each
catalog  is organized according to a structure based on the unique
characteristics of its objects. For example, Architecture is indexed by site,
building type, period, and date, while Coins are indexed by mint, region,
issuing authority, denomination, and date.<p>
All objects in the Art &amp; Archaeology catalogs are documented in text and
visual formats. Each entry is accompanied by illustrated site plans and color
photographs, as applicable. The catalogs are also linked with one another. For
example, the Sculpture catalog indicates the building on which a sculpture is
located. The Architecture catalog indicates the site at which the building is
located. The Archaeological Keyword Search enables you to browse and
investigate objects documented in the catalogs.<p>
You may use the Links Menu from another Perseus resource to explore a theme in
Art &amp; Archaeology. If you have selected text before choosing an Art &amp;
Archaeology catalog from the Links Menu, you will go directly to the related
article in that catalog. <p>
Each object in Perseus is documented according to the best information
available. Not all characteristics are known for all objects and so are
sometimes blank. Dates identified for archaeological objects are approximate.
<h3>
5.1 ART &amp; ARCHAEOLOGY INDEX</h3>
The Art &amp; Archaeology Index is accessible by clicking the Art &amp;
Archaeology icon on the Perseus Gateway. The catalogs and indexes of Art &amp;
Archaeology are presented in a scrolling text field (figure 5.1).<p>

<t>	Click an index name under one of the Art &amp; Archaeology
catalogs.<p>
Perseus displays a detailed index of the resources available for the selected
category. For example, if you clicked "Index by region" under the category
Sites, a detailed index of sites sorted by region appears.
<h3>
5.2  SITES</h3>
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.53.gif">
<h4>
SITE INDEXES</h4>
Sites are indexed in three ways: by region, type, and period. All sites are
also listed alphabetically. The description here uses the Index by region as an
example. Regions encompass cities or sites that may have belonged to different
political units at different times. Assignment of cities and sites to regions
follows accepted conventions for the classical period. <p>
<t>	Click "Index by region" under the category Sites on the Art
&amp; Archaeology Index.<p>
Perseus displays a more detailed index that shows the list of sites in the left
column. On any of the detailed index displays, the list in the left column is
based on the type of index selected, which is indicated by the icon and title
at the top of the display. The detailed index for sites listed by region is
depicted below (figure 5.2).
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.54.gif"><p>

<t>	Hold the mouse button down on the Index Type button to select a
different index .<p>
Try the other three indexes. Return the index selection to the Index by region
to follow the rest of this description.<p>
The left column lists regions. <p>
<t>	Click Elis under the region list in the left column.<p>
The right column lists the sites in the selected region, Elis. The name of the
selected region appears above the right column. The sites are listed in two
categories: Documented and Undocumented. Documented indicates that a full
catalog entry exists for the site. Undocumented indicates that the catalog
entry consists only of a Site Summary, blank except for region information.
Undocumented sites are included to provide access to Perseus images of these
sites.<p>
<t>	Click Olympia under the site list in the right column.<p>
For sites listed under Documented, the full catalog entry consists of a Site
Summary and a Site Description.
<h4>
SITE SUMMARY</h4>
Perseus displays a Summary of the selected site.<p>
The Site Summary for Olympia is depicted below (figure 5.3). The name of this
site is displayed above the site information.
