CHAPTER 6: ATLAS</h2>
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.61.gif"><p>
The Atlas resource contains three types of maps:  general maps, regional maps,
and satellite photographs. General maps depict an overview of a wide region
(the Eastern Mediterranean, the Small Map of the Greek World, and the Greek
World). Regional maps show Greece in greater detail and depict smaller regions
(Attica, Corinthia, and the Argolid). Satellite photographs are color images of
mainland Greece. (Satellite photographs require eight-bit grayscale or color
systems.)  
<h3>
6.1  MAP LIST FOR ATLAS</h3>
The Map List shows the maps available in the Perseus Atlas, according to the
type of map. All maps in the Atlas can be accessed from the Map List  (figure
6.1).<p>

Try clicking different maps. Then click the Go Back icon on the Navigator to
return to the Map List.
<h3>
6.2  GENERAL MAPS</h3>
The General Maps depict the Eastern Mediterranean, the Small Map of the Greek
World (figure 6.2), and the Greek World. The first two show a wide region that
can be displayed on Macintosh monitors of any size. The third, the Greek World
Map, is larger than the monitor and can be viewed from a scroll window. The
Greek World Map is described  in section 6.3.

The Eastern Mediterranean and the Small Map of the Greek World do not have an
Atlas Menu and sites cannot be plotted on them.<p>
<t>	Click a region on the Small Map of the Greek World to see that
part of the Greek World. 
<h3>
6.3  GREEK WORLD MAP</h3>
The third General Map is the Greek World Map. This map has a special Atlas Menu
that appears in the menu bar to the right of the Perseus Menu. You can use the
Atlas Menu to identify sites, manipulate the map's appearance, save and
retrieve sets of sites you have identified, and plot and save custom sites on
the map. The Greek World Map with the Atlas Menu selected is depicted below
(figure 6.3).

<h4>
GREEK WORLD MAP DISPLAY</h4>
The Greek World Map is available as one of the General Maps. You can also zoom
into the Greek World Map by clicking areas of the Eastern Mediterranean Map and
the Small Map of the Greek World. <p>
When the Greek World Map is shown, a floating window appears to show the map's
scale, a directional indicator, and the drawing credits. This window can be
closed or repositioned on the screen. A second floating window appears with a
small rectangle that indicates the relation of the current screen to the full
size of the Greek World Map. <p>
<t>	Move the rectangle to move around the full map window. (Place
the cursor in the center of the rectangle and drag it to a new location.)<p>
<t>	Resize the current map window to increase or decrease the map
size. (Place the cursor near an edge or corner of the rectangle and drag it to
resize the rectangle.)<p>
If necessary, review the information in chapter 2, "Basics," to use the scroll
window.
<h4>
ATLAS MENU FOR GREEK WORLD MAP</h4>
The Atlas Menu appears in the menu bar when you see the Greek World Map.
Choices in this Atlas Menu allow you to locate and hide sites on the map,
change the map's appearance, and save and load sets of existing and custom
sites. Possible changes in the map's appearance include seeing its scale,
showing latitude and longitude lines, and selecting flashing areas for which a
regional map is available.
<h5>
Locate and Hide Sites</h5>
Perseus contains information on the location of numerous sites relevant to
classical Greece. You can identify and plot sites by choosing them from an
alphabetical list. Spellings, however, may vary from other known spellings,
such as those found in the primary texts. In this case, try alternate spellings
of the sites (for example, Gnossus and Knossos).<p>
<t>	Choose Select Sites A-F in the menu by holding the mouse down
on Atlas and releasing it on this choice.<p>
A dialog box (figure 6.4) appears with all sites, in alphabetical order,A
through F, that can be plotted on the Greek World Map. 
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.65.gif"><p>
<b><p>
Figure 6.4  Site dialog box for plotting sites</b><p>
<t>	Click a site in the list, then click Plot.<p>
Perseus plots the selected site, indicating its location with a small dot and
its name by a label. <p>
<t>	When you are plotting a site with the site dialog box, click a
button for other sites to see the next alphabetical list of sites.<p>
When you are plotting a site with the site dialog box, you may plot several
sites from the same dialog box by using the Shift-click option, which allows
you to select more than one site in the list.<p>
Plot as many sites as you like. You may hide a site by choosing Hide Sites from
the Atlas Menu. A site dialog box appears listing the sites that have been
plotted. You may also hide all sites plotted by choosing Hide All from the
Atlas Menu.<i><p>
NOTE: Hide All cannot be undone. After using Hide All, you must replot the
sites one at a time. To save a set of sites that you have plotted, use the Save
and Load functions described below.</i>
<h5>
Locate Regions</h5>
Cities or sites may have belonged to different political units at different
times. Assignment of cities and sites to regions follows accepted conventions
for the classical period. <p>
<t>	Choose Locate Regions in the menu by holding the mouse down on
Atlas and releasing it on this choice.<p>
A dialog box appears with all regions, in alphabetical order, that can be
plotted on the Greek World Map. <p>
<t>	Click a region in the list, then click Plot.<p>
Perseus plots all available sites in the selected region, indicating their
locations with a small dot. 
<h5>
Scale</h5>
This feature shows the scale of the map in a floating window, if the scale is
not currently displayed. 
<h5>
Show LatLon Lines</h5>
<t>	Choose Show LatLon Lines in the menu by holding the mouse down
on Atlas and releasing it on this choice.<p>
Latitude and longitude indications appear on the Greek World Map. This menu
item toggles between the show and hide commands. 
<h5>

the Greek World Map.<p>
Flashing areas indicate that a Regional Map is available for that area. <p>
<t>	Click one of the active areas to see the Regional Map for that
area.
<h5>
Save and Load Set of Sites</h5>
After you have plotted several sites on the map, you may wish to save this set
of sites for future reference.<p>
<t>	Choose Save Set in the Atlas Menu to create a file for the
sites. <p>
A dialog box appears in which you name the file and select a disk on which to
save the file.<p>
<t>	Choose Load Set in the Atlas Menu to load the set of sites. <p>
A dialog box appears in which you identify the file where the sites were
stored.<p>
<t>	Select the file and click Open. <p>
The set of sites in this file will then be plotted.
<h5>
Create, Save, and Load Custom Sites</h5>
You can plot your own sites rather than using the sites available on the
alphabetical lists. <p>
<t>	Choose Custom Sites in the Atlas Menu to create a custom site.
<p>
A dialog box instructs you to click a location for the custom site.<p>
<t>	Click a site on the map.<p>
A dialog box asks you to name the site.<p>
<t>	Type in a name for the site you are creating.<p>

<p>
A dialog box appears in which you identify the file in which the custom sites
were stored.
<h3>
6.4  REGIONAL MAPS</h3>
Regional Maps are available for the regions Attica, Corinthia, and the Argolid.
These regions flash on the Greek World Map when you choose Flash Details from
the Atlas Menu. Regional Maps are also accessible from the Map List.<p>
<t>	Choose Flash Details from the Atlas Menu while you are on the
Greek World Map to highlight regions with Regional Maps.<p>
<t>	Click a region that flashed to see the Regional Map.<p>
Regional Maps illustrate the physical characteristics of the area through
shading. They have many of the same features as the Greek World Map, such as
the Atlas Menu and a scroll window display. If necessary, read the information
under section 6.3, "Greek World Map," on using the Atlas Menu and the scroll
window.<p>
A Regional Map with the Atlas Menu selected is depicted below (figure 6.5).

<h4>
INDEX OF SATELLITE PHOTOGRAPHS</h4>
The satellite photographs are color images of mainland Greece. (The display of
satellite photographs requires an eight-bit grayscale or color system.)  <p>
Areas for which a satellite photograph is available are listed alphabetically

<t>	Click the name of an area to see a digitized image of a
satellite photograph.<i><p>
NOTE: The images are not stored in HyperCard and therefore should be treated
differently from other Perseus elements. In particular, you must click the
close box to remove the image. If the window is not active, click in the title
bar. If you use the Navigator while an image window is open, Perseus will
respond, but you will be unable to see the response because the image window
will be covering the active HyperCard window.</i>
