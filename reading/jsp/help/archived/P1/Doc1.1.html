CHAPTER 1:  SETUP</h2>
<h3>
1.1  HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS</h3>
<h4>
HARDWARE</h4>
<h5>
Macintosh computer  </h5>
A Macintosh LC with a hard drive is the minimum <i>recommended</i>
configuration for Perseus, although Perseus will run on a Macintosh Classic
with a hard drive. The faster the Macintosh--for example, a Macintosh IIci--the
better the response time of Perseus. Perseus will work with just two megabytes
of random access memory (RAM), but it will work much better with four or more
megabytes.<p>
There are two basic configurations for using Perseus. One is an individual
computer with an attached compact disc-read only memory (CD-ROM) drive. This
configuration is useful when just one person will use Perseus at any time. The
second configuration involves the use of a file server on a network, useful if
several people require simultaneous access to Perseus or if the cost of
additional CD-ROM hardware is greater than the investment in the additional
computer to be used as the file server. <p>
An optimal setup is one with a fast computer and a large screen. A color
monitor is desirable (see below). 
<h5>
Color monitor (optional for Perseus 1.0)</h5>
Every feature of Perseus 1.0, except the display of digitized color
photographs, will run on a black-and-white monitor. Future versions of Perseus
will employ tools that enhance the display of color images and text. Consider
investing in a color monitor to profit from the anticipated upgrades of color
display in future versions of Perseus. 
<h5>
Apple-compatible CD-ROM drive</h5>
A CD-ROM drive is necessary to read the Perseus CD-ROM. CD-ROM drives are sold
in different configurations and with different cable components.<p>
To connect the CD-ROM drive to your computer, you need a Small Computer System
Interface (SCSI) cable. You may also need an SCSI terminator, if you do not
already have a terminated SCSI device attached to your Macintosh. Consult the
technical documentation for your CD-ROM drive.
<h5>
Videodisc player and monitor (optional)</h5>
A videodisc player is needed only if you wish to use the Perseus videodisc
instead of the digitized images available on the Perseus CD-ROM.<p>
Possible options for the player include: Pioneer 4200, Pioneer 6000A, Pioneer
6010A, Sony LDP 1200, Sony 1500, Sony 2000, and Hitachi 9550. Any standard
video or TV monitor will work.<p>
You will need an audiovisual cable to connect the videodisc player to the
monitor and a communications cable to connect the player to the Macintosh. The
player-to-monitor cable is standard, and the right connectors may be bought at
any electronics store. The player-to-Macintosh cable must either be bought with
the player or made especially for it. Each player is different, and cables are
not interchangeable. 
<h4>
SOFTWARE</h4>
<h5>
System and Finder 6.0.5 or later</h5>
Perseus will also operate with System 7.0, although few features of System 7.0
are integrated with Perseus. 
<h5>
HyperCard version 2.0 or later </h5>
HyperCard is free with any new Macintosh. It is also available for
approximately fifty dollars from Claris Corporation (1-800-628-2100).<p>
If you have more than one version of HyperCard, it is a good idea to copy your
HyperCard 2.0<i> </i>application into your Perseus folder. HyperCard<i>
</i>searches for files in its own folder before looking in other folders on
your disk or system. When HyperCard, the Home stack, and any other Perseus
stacks are all in the same folder, you can be sure that HyperCard<i> </i>has
found your Perseus stacks and that the correct version of HyperCard is running.
<h5>
CD-ROM software drivers</h5>
This software should be on a disk that comes with your CD-ROM drive. 
<h5>
32-Bit QuickDraw</h5>
This software is part of Apple System Software and is distributed with all
recent systems. If your system lacks 32-Bit QuickDraw, contact your local Apple
dealer. 
<h5>
SMK GreekKeys (optional)</h5>
Perseus supports the SMK GreekKeys character set for displaying Greek
characters on the screen. To type accented Greek, you must have SMK GreekKeys
installed in your system. This is strongly recommended.<p>
SMK GreekKeys is a keyboard program, designed for the Macintosh, that enables
you to type accented Greek letter fonts with a standard Macintosh keyboard.
Greek letters are paired with keys on the keyboard, and diacritics are created
by pressing the Option key in combination with a letter key.<p>
Perseus contains an SMK font so that Greek text can be displayed in HyperCard.
Although you can see this font displayed, you must have the SMK GreekKeys font
installed in your system to print cards and copy and paste text. You must also
have SMK GreekKeys if you wish to type in Greek while using Perseus.<p>
SMK GreekKeys is available from Scholar's Press Software, P.O. Box 15399,
Atlanta, GA 30333, (404)636-4757.
<h5>
Perseus data</h5>
The Perseus CD-ROM and the optional Perseus videodisc comprise the data for
Perseus. Perseus stacks that should be copied to your hard drive are on the
CD-ROM.
<h3>
1.2  INSTALLATION</h3>
<h4>
HARDWARE</h4>
<t>	Connect the CD-ROM drive to the Macintosh. <p>
SCSI devices must have a terminator at each end of the SCSI chain. The CD-ROM
drive documentation should describe proper cabling. In some cases, the
terminator must be on the same port as the cable, in others on top or bottom.
If you have difficulties, consult your hardware documentation and try altering
the configuration.<p>
<t>	Install the proper CD-ROM software drivers on your Macintosh
system.<p>
Your CD-ROM drive documentation should explain how to install this software. <p>
<t>	Connect the videodisc player to the video monitor (if the
videodisc is used). <p>
If you are using a video monitor, this equipment is connected through
audiovisual RCA cables. Other cable configurations are required for monitors
without RCA input jacks.<p>
When you put the videodisc into the player, you should see the color test bars
on the monitor screen. If the player has front-panel controls, you should be
able to check the connection by stepping through some images on the
videodisc.<p>
<t>	Connect the videodisc player to the Macintosh (if the videodisc
is used). <p>
Use the correct cable to connect the communications port of the videodisc
player to the appropriate port on the Macintosh. The appropriate cable is often
provided with the videodisc player; if it is not, consult your local dealer.
Check the baud rate setting on the videodisc player. The correct setting for
computer interface should be specified in your videodisc player documentation.
<h4>
SOFTWARE</h4>
Software installation requires copying Perseus files from the CD-ROM to your
hard drive, installing 32-Bit QuickDraw, and checking the memory allotted to
HyperCard.
<h5>
Turn on all equipment</h5>
<t>	Turn on the CD-ROM drive. <p>
<t>	Turn on the videodisc player and video monitor (if
applicable).<p>
<t>	Turn on the Macintosh.<p>
Be sure to turn on the CD-ROM drive and videodisc player before turning on the
Macintosh.
<h5>
Install QuickDraw</h5>
The 32-Bit QuickDraw system file is part of Apple System Software and is
distributed with all recent systems. If this file is not yet part of your
system, install it by running the System Installer for System 6.0.5 or later.
Select 32-Bit QuickDraw from the Customize options. You can also locate the
32-Bit QuickDraw file on your system disks and drag it into your System folder.
After installing QuickDraw, restart your Macintosh.
<h5>
Check memory</h5>
Perseus needs at least two megabytes of memory to run properly. If you are
running Multifinder, you must set the "application memory size" of HyperCard to
at least 2000. If you have more than two megabytes of RAM on your Macintosh,
Perseus will perform even better if you allot increased memory to HyperCard. <p>
Click the HyperCard icon while the application is not running and choose Get
Info from the File Menu. The lower right-hand corner of the dialog box contains
a number that reflects the current memory setting. Type "2000" into the box.
<h5>
Load Perseus CD-ROM</h5>
<t>	Insert the Perseus CD-ROM into your CD-ROM drive.<p>
An icon called Perseus appears on the right of your screen.after a brief
interval. The red light on the CD-ROM drive will remain lit for a few seconds,
flash at irregular intervals, and finally go out. 
<h5>
Copy Perseus files</h5>
The Perseus CD-ROM contains a folder with files that must be copied onto your
hard drive after all equipment is connected and turned on. Conveniently enough,
this folder is named Install Me. The folder contains files that should be
placed in a folder called Perseus on your hard drive. <p>
<t>	Open the contents of the CD-ROM by double-clicking it from the
desktop. Open the folder named Install Me.<p>
<t>	Create a new folder on your hard drive by choosing New Folder
from the File Menu. Name this folder Perseus.<p>
<t>	Copy the files in the Install Me folder into the Perseus folder
on your hard drive.<p>
Although Perseus can be run directly from the CD-ROM, it is not recommended.
Running Perseus from the  CD-ROM is very slow.<p>
During this procedure, you should ensure that there is only one copy of
HyperCard 2.0 on your system. If you wish to preserve older versions of
HyperCard, be sure to place HyperCard 2.0 in the Perseus folder. Having the
correct version of HyperCard and the Home stack in your Perseus folder is
extremely important. If Perseus is the only application that uses HyperCard,
the easiest configuration may be to place HyperCard in your Perseus folder.<p>
Your Perseus folder should now contain the following files:<p>
Notebook <p>
Paths<p>
Perseus Gateway<p>
Perseus Shared<p>
Path Shared<p>
Text Shared<p>
Home (placed in this folder optionally by you)<p>
HyperCard 2.0 (placed in this folder optionally by you)<p>
<p>
<t>	Copy and rename the new Path and Notebook stacks to personalize
them, for example, "Elli's Paths" and "Elli's Notebook."<p>
By renaming these stacks, you can distinguish your Paths and Notebooks from
those of other users. If several people are using Perseus at one time, a stack
being used by more than one person cannot be changed. Being able to change and
annotate the Path and Notebook stacks is very important if you use these
features. Copy and rename these stacks as part of your software installation.<p>
For more about using Paths and Notebooks, read chapter 9, "Utilities." 
<h3>
1.3  STARTUP</h3>
After setting up the hardware and installing the software, you are ready to
start up Perseus. If you encounter any hardware or software problems, see
Troubleshooting, below.<p>
<t>	Double-click Perseus Gateway in the Perseus folder you
installed on your hard drive. <p>
The cursor changes to a watch as Perseus initializes. Once the cursor becomes
the hand or the arrow, Perseus is ready for use. The Perseus Gateway  appears
on your screen with a small floating window (the Navigator). In addition,
several new items appear in the menu bar, including Links and Perseus.<p>
Turn to chapter  2 for an explanation of the basics of Perseus.
<h3>
1.4  TROUBLESHOOTING</h3>
 <p>
The following checks should help if you encounter problems as you set up
Perseus.
<h4>
HARDWARE</h4>
If something is wrong, the CD-ROM drive may just spin, and the little red light
either will stay lit and not flash or will flash constantly at regular
intervals. If this continues for more than two minutes, press the button on the
front of the CD-ROM drive, hold it for a few seconds, and then release. The
disk should eject. Check all connections and software installations. Check SCSI
terminators, and check that you have the correct CD-ROM drivers. <p>
If you are using a videodisc player and cannot display images from the
videodisc, check the baud rate setting on your videodisc player (specified in
the player documentation).
<h4>
SOFTWARE</h4>
If the cables and terminators are properly connected, try turning the Macintosh
and CD-ROM drive off and on again. (Turn the CD-ROM drive on before turning on
the Macintosh.) <p>
If you are not running the correct version of HyperCard (version 2.0 or later),
an error message will indicate that you need another version. Check whether the
hard disk contains other versions of HyperCard, and check that the correct
version is on the hard disk. If necessary,  put HyperCard 2.0 into the Perseus
folder.<p>
A related problem may be the existence of multiple copies of the HyperCard Home
stack. The Home stack is very important in using Perseus, because the Home
stack specifies the location of files and instructs HyperCard where on your
hard drive to look for Perseus data. Double-click on the Home icon from the
Macintosh desktop and move forward in this stack (by clicking the forward
arrow) until you see the list of search paths for stacks, applications, and
documents. Check that the search paths are specified correctly in relation to
your software configuration.<p>
If you see the error message "Cannot open MDB Index," check the path names in
the correct version of the HyperCard Home card.<p>
If the color images from the CD-ROM do not  appear on the screen, check that
32-Bit QuickDraw is installed in your system folder.<p>
If you are unable to type accented Greek, check that SMK GreekKeys has been
installed in your system.  If SMK GreekKeys is installed and you are still
unable to type accented Greek, try installing the Sparta font from the Perseus
Shared stack in your system fonts.
