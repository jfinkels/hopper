The Historical Overview is a narrative history of ancient Greece and the Golden
Age of Athens in the fifth century B.C. Highlighted words and phrases in the

Each topic card is titled "The Golden Age of Athens in the Fifth Century BC."
The topic's location in the outline is shown above the narrative. Below the
main title bar are two buttons, Table of Contents and Hide Links/Unlock Text.
<h5>
Location in outline</h5>
The topic you selected and its location in the outline are shown above the
narrative. The location is indicated by the major topic headers preceding the
topic you have selected. In the example of figure 4.2, topic III A.5 is
preceded by the more general topics III A and III.<p>
<t>	Click III A, The Establishment of an Athenian Empire, to go
directly to that topic.<p>
<t>	Click the right arrow in the Navigator several times to move
forward to topic III A.5.<p>
In this example, you must click the right arrow six times to progress from

<h5>
Linked Text and Locked Text</h5>
A toggle button changes the state of the text between shown and hidden links
and between locked and unlocked text. This button is named Hide Links/Unlock
Text or Show Links/Lock Text, depending on the state of the toggle. <p>
Narrative in the Historical Overview is linked thematically to other Perseus
resources. Linked text is underlined in gray and appears when the text field is
locked. Text may also be unlocked so that you can use the text select tool
(indicated by an I-beam cursor) to select text. After selecting text, you can
use the Links Menu to find connections in other resources or the Perseus Menu
to add the card to a Perseus path. For more information, see chapter 2,
"Basics," on the Links Menu and chapter 9, "Utilities," on Paths. <p>
<t>	Click Hide Links/Unlock Text to remove the gray underline from
the text and disable the links to other Perseus resources.<p>
Note that the name of the button changes (toggles). When text is unlocked, you
can change as well as select the text on the screen. These changes are not
permanent, and they disappear when you leave the card.<p>
<t>	Click Show Links/Lock Text to show the gray underline in the
text and enable the links.<p>
	In figure 4.2, the phrase "case of the city-state of the island of Thasos" is
linked to other parts of Perseus.
<h5>
Use an existing link</h5>
<t>	Hold the mouse button down on an underlined phrase to see a
pop-up menu of the links from that word. <p>
To follow the example here, hold the mouse button down on the phrase "case of
the city-state of the island of Thasos."<p>
Links in the Historical Overview are coded according to category. Links to
other parts of Perseus include the Atlas, site plans, texts, and views. Links
to primary texts are indicated by the standard system of abbreviations, which
includes the author, work, and references to the book, chapter, and line, as
applicable. Appendix C contains the standard system of abbreviations used in
the Historical Overview links.<p>
A pop-up menu for the linked text is depicted below (figure 4.3). The phrase in
this figure is linked to a primary text reference, a site plan, and a view.

<t>	Release the mouse button on a link from the pop-up menu. <p>
Try each available link in this example.<p>
<t>	Click the Go Back icon on the Navigator to return to the
Historical Overview card. 
<h5>
Try your own link</h5>
As with almost all of the Perseus resources, you can explore the relations of
narrative, primary texts, maps, and images by using the Links Menu.<p>
<t>	Click Hide Links/Unlock Text on the same topic described in the
above example (III A.5, The Rebellion of Thasos).<p>
<t>	Select the word "Thasos."<p>
<t>	Hold the mouse button down on the Links Menu, and release it on
Sites.<p>
Because you have activated this choice on the Links Menu while a word was
selected in your current location, Perseus goes to the selected resource (the
Sites catalog) and searches for Thasos. Within seconds, you will see a catalog
entry for the site Thasos.<p>
<t>	Click the Go Back icon on the Navigator to return to your place
in the Historical Overview.<p>
Try other types of links, such as links with other art and archaeology
catalogs, the philological tools, and the word searches.
