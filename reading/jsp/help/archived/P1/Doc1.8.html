CHAPTER 8:  TOOLS &amp; REFERENCES</h2>
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.81.gif"><p>
The Tools &amp; References include the Encyclopedia, the Philological Tools, a
Bibliography, Word Searches, and Archaeological Tools. Each tool or reference
is further categorized by subtopic. 
<h3>
8.1  TOOLS &amp; REFERENCES INDEX</h3>
The Tools &amp; References Index (figure 8.1) displays the names of tools and
references in Perseus and provides access to them. As with other Perseus
indexes, the main categories are shown in boldface, with subcategories shown
beneath each main category. You must select a subcategory to go to that tool or
reference. <p>

<h3>
8.2  ENCYCLOPEDIA</h3>
The Encyclopedia is composed of short articles on classical civilization, art,
and architecture based on several sources. Some articles have accompanying
illustrations. Approximately three hundred articles were written expressly for
the Perseus Project. These articles focus on regions of Greece, biographies of
ancient authors, terminology for art and architecture, and some musical
instruments. The rest of the encyclopedia entries (approximately 3,500) are
derived from the indexes of Loeb Classical Library editions of Apollodorus and
Herodotus. These entries contain explanations of and can be used to find
precise text references in works by Apollodorus and Herodotus. Chapter 7,
"Primary Texts" describes the use of text references in the subject indexes for
Apollodorus and Herodotus. <p>
The Encyclopedia is indexed alphabetically and by subject .

<h3>
8.3  PHILOLOGICAL TOOLS</h3>
Four Philological Tools are available to explore the usage, vocabulary,
grammar, and syntax of ancient Greek. They are the Compound Verb List,
English-Greek Word List, Greek-English Lexicon, and Morphological Analysis tool.
<h4>
DESCRIPTION AND LIMITATIONS OF THE PHILOLOGICAL TOOLS</h4>
Underlying the Philological Tools is a morphological database that was created
by parsing every Greek word in the Perseus primary texts and storing the
results in Perseus. Approximately fifty thousand items are included in the
database. The morphological database provides a foundation for the Philological
Tools and allows you to perform two strategic functions. First, you can
determine the morphological analysis for any  word in a text, and second, you
can find all instances of a Greek word in a particular text.<p>
The morphological parser identifies as many possible analyses for a given form
as it can. When more than one analysis is possible, however, the parser does
not identify which analysis is the appropriate one based on the context in
which the word was used. The parser focuses entirely on the Greek word and does
not consider the context of its source. 
<h4>
COMMON FUNCTIONS IN THE PHILOLOGICAL TOOLS</h4>
The Philological Tools are functionally linked to each other and to the Greek
and English Word Search tools for maximum flexibility. The functional
integration of the tools is provided through four buttons. Depending on the
tool selected, these buttons provide access to other tools. <p>
Use of the Philological Tools centers on the selection of Greek and English
text, depending on the tool to be activated. The four common buttons of the
Philological Tools are described below. 
<h5>
Analyze (for Morphological Analysis)</h5>
Analyze activates the Morphological Analysis tool and displays the
morphological analysis for the selected Greek word. Selecting English text or
proper nouns will result in a message that no analysis is offered for this word.
<h5>
Define (for Greek-English Lexicon)</h5>
Define activates the Greek-English Lexicon and displays a definition for the
selected Greek text. The Greek-English Lexicon is available as either a small
or a full lexicon. Selecting English text will result in a message that the
selected text is not in the dictionary.
<h5>
Eng-Gr (for English-Greek Word List)</h5>
Eng-Gr activates the English-Greek Word List and searches in the Greek
dictionary for words whose definition contains the selected word. The selected
text must be in English. Selecting Greek text will result in a message that the
lemma is not found in the dictionary.
<h5>
Show Usage (for Greek Word Search)</h5>
Show Usage opens the Greek Word Search and displays citations for all forms of
the selected Greek word in an author's works. Selecting English text will
result in a message that the lemma is not used in the selected author's  works. 
<h4>
COMPOUND VERB LIST</h4>
The Compound Verb List finds all the compounds of a given simple verb in a
selected author by searching in the dictionary. <p>
<t>	Click Compound Verb List under Philological Tools in the Tools
&amp; Reference Index.<p>
The Compound Verb List appears (figure 8.5). This tool also provides access to
two other philological tools, Define and Show Usage.
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.86.gif"><p>
<b><p>
Figure 8.5  Compound Verb List</b><p>
<p>
<t>	Click the "List compound forms of" field to make the insertion
point appear.<p>
<t>	Paste in a simple verb from the clipboard or type in a verb
using SMK GreekKeys. You must be precise in typing accents and diacritics with
SMK GreekKeys.<p>
<t>	Select an author for the compound verb search by holding the
mouse button down on the pop-up menu for authors. Release the mouse button on
the author of your choice.<p>
<t>	Click Show List to activate the search.<p>
The result of the search for compound forms of the verb in the selected author
is displayed in the text field on the lower half of the screen. A citation and
verb form are listed for each compound form found in the search.
<h4>
ENGLISH-GREEK WORD LIST</h4>
The English-Greek Word List (figure 8.6) searches through the Greek lexicon for
words whose definitions contain the selected word (or the word in the "String
to find" field). The tool is based on the entries in Liddell and Scott's
<i>Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon</i>. <p>
Not every English word in each dictionary entry has been indexed. The
English-Greek Word List search will find words only in the actual English
definition--that is, words that are italicized in the print dictionary.<p>
If you choose the English-Greek Word List from the Tools &amp; References
Index, you must enter a search string. If you choose Eng-Gr from another
Philological Tool and have already selected a word, the tool is automatically
activated. 
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.87.gif"><p>
<b><p>
Figure 8.6  English-Greek Word List</b>
<h5>
Analyze, Define, and Show Usage</h5>
The English-Greek Word List searches in the Greek dictionary for words whose
definition contains the selected English word. It is linked with the
Morphological Analysis, the Greek-English Lexicon, and the Greek Word Search.
<p>
<t>	Click Analyze, Define, or Show Usage while text is selected to
activate any of the corresponding tools.
<h5>
String to find</h5>
<t>	Click the "String to find" field to make the insertion point
appear.<p>
<t>	Type or paste in English text. <p>
<t>	Select a type of search (Word or Starting Characters) by
holding the mouse button down on the pop-up menu for type of search. Release
the mouse button on your choice.<p>
The Starting Characters search is useful if you wish to broaden your search. It
will find all words that begin with the characters you have typed in the
"String to find" field. In contrast, the Word search will find only exact
matches to the string you typed in the field.<p>
For example, typing the string "aes" and conducting a Word search will result
in only one identified word. Conducting a Starting Character search for the
same string will result in four words that occur in five entries.<p>
<t>	Click Look Up to activate the search.<p>
The result of the search is displayed in the text field on the lower left of
the screen. The search does not find text that is a direct translation of the
selected word; instead, the search identifies Greek lemmas that contain the
selected English text in their definitions. Further analysis of the Greek words
found in the search is possible through use of the Analyze, Define, and Show
Usage buttons. (Note that a lemma cannot be analyzed with the Morphological
Analysis tool.)<p>
Another feature of the English-Greek Word List enables you to explore the
appearance of the Greek words in selected authors. <p>
<t>	In the right column, select an author by holding the mouse
button down on the pop-up menu for authors who use these words. Release the
mouse button on your choice.<p>
<t>	Click Search next to the author name.<p>
The results show which of the words on the left appear in the selected author. 
<h4>
GREEK-ENGLISH LEXICON</h4>
The Greek-English Lexicon contains the Greek and English definitions from
Liddell and Scott's <i>Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon</i>. The full lexicon
(figure 8.7) and the small lexicon (figure 8.8) are depicted below. 
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.88.gif"><p>
<b><p>
Figure 8.7  Greek-English Lexicon (full lexicon)</b><p>
If you have chosen the Greek-English Lexicon from the Tools &amp; References
Index, you will see the full lexicon, and you must enter a Greek word in the
"Word to look up" field. If you have chosen Define from another Philological
Tool and you have already selected a word, a small version of the Greek-English
Lexicon appears, and you do not have the option to enter your own word to
define. The expanded lexicon is available from the small lexicon by clicking
Full Lexicon. <p>
                    
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.89.gif"><b><p>
Figure 8.8  Greek-English Lexicon (small lexicon)</b>
<h5>
Analyze, Eng-Gr, and Show Usage</h5>
The Greek-English Lexicon is linked with the Morphological Analysis, the
English-Greek Word List, and the Greek Word Search. <p>
<t>	Click Analyze, Eng-Gr, or Show Usage while text is selected to
activate any of the corresponding tools. <p>
Note that a lemma cannot be analyzed with the Morphological Analysis tool.
<h5>
Look Up Word</h5>
<t>	Click the "Word to look up" field to make the insertion point
appear.<p>
<t>	Type or paste in a Greek word. <p>
To type Greek text, you must have SMK GreekKeys installed in your system. You
must be precise in typing accents and diacritical marks using SMK GreekKeys.<p>
<t>	Click Look Up  to see a definition of the word. <p>
The full lexicon shows the search results in three fields. The first field, in
the lower left corner, gives the definition of the word. The "Refers to" field
indicates root words from which the selected word is derived, as listed in
Liddell and Scott's <i>Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon</i>. The "Referred to
by" field shows words that refer to the selected word as a root word, as listed
in the <i>Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon</i>.<p>
<t>	Select any word in the three fields.<p>
 <t>	Click Look Up to see the definition of the newly selected
word.<p>
Try also using the functions Analyze, Eng-Gr, and Show Usage with words
selected from the search results field.
<h4>
MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS </h4>
The Morphological Analysis tool (figure 8.9) parses and describes Greek word
forms, showing the lemma and the related analysis, including the word form and
part of speech. The Morphological Analysis tool is also available directly from
Primary Text displays through the Analyze button. <p>
Please note that this tool performs a morphological analysis, not a syntactic
analysis, of the Greek word. If the form you are analyzing could be formed from
more than one word, the Morphological Analysis tool will display all possible
lemmas and analyses. It does not indicate which is correct for the particular
form you selected.<p>
If you have chosen Morphological Analysis from the Tools &amp; References
Index, you must enter a word to analyze. If you have chosen Analyze from
another Philological Tool and have already selected a word, the tool will be
automatically activated. 
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.810.gif"><p>
<b><p>
Figure 8.9  Morphological Analysis tool</b>
<h5>
Define, Eng-Gr, and Show Usage</h5>
The Morphological Analysis tool is linked with the Greek-English Lexicon, the
English-Greek Word List, and the Greek Word Search. <p>
<t>	Click Define, Eng-Gr, or Show Usage while text is selected to
activate any of the corresponding tools.
<h5>
Analyze Word</h5>
<t>	Click the  "Word" field to make the insertion point appear.<p>
<t>	Type or paste in a Greek word. <p>
To type Greek text, you must have SMK GreekKeys installed in your system. You
must be precise in typing accents and diacritical marks using SMK GreekKeys.<p>
<t>	Click Analyze  to parse the word. <p>
The result of the morphological analysis is displayed in the field on the lower
half of the screen. The lemma is shown in boldface, followed by its possible
forms and their parts of speech. A word analysis might result in more than one
lemma. Abbreviations used in the word analysis are described in appendix C.<p>
The first part of the analysis indicates the type of stem on which the word is
formed. The rest of the analysis identifies the form.<p>
Try using the functions Analyze, Eng-Gr, and Show Usage with words selected
from the morphological analysis results.
<h3>
8.4  BIBLIOGRAPHY</h3>
The Bibliography contains citations from sources used to compile the Perseus
database and lists sources external to Perseus. 
<h4>
SOURCES USED</h4>
Although you may read this information in a linear fashion by clicking Sources
Used on the Tools &amp; References Index and using the Go Forward and Go
Previous icons on the Navigator, you will be unable to relate the source to a
specific Perseus item. Instead, the Sources Used information is pertinent when
you request it in relation to a specific Perseus resource. For example, Site
Descriptions in the Art &amp; Archaeology resource show sources used to compile
the information. 
<h4>
FURTHER SOURCES </h4>
Further Sources are further bibliographic references for the interested reader
. A list of further sources is depicted below (figure 8.10).

<h3>
8.5  WORD SEARCHES</h3>
Perseus can perform word searches in English and Greek texts and provide
information on usage of words by selected authors.
<h4>
ENGLISH WORD SEARCH</h4>
The English Word Search (figure 8.11) is an index of all English words in
Perseus. This tool identifies the occurrences of an English word in the
translation of all the primary texts or the works of a selected author and in
the Atlas, Encyclopedia, Historical Overview, and catalogs of archaeological
objects. The search can be made for words or starting characters. 
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.812.gif"><p>

<h4>
GREEK WORD SEARCH</h4>
The Greek Word Search (figure 8.12) identifies the occurrences of a Greek word
in the works of a selected author. 
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.813.gif"><p>
<b><p>
Figure 8.12  Greek Word Search </b><p>
Search types include lemmatized and compound verb searches as well as word and
starting character searches. An additional feature is the ability to sort the
search results by author's work or by form of the word searched. In addition,
three Philological Tools are available.
<h5>
Analyze, Define, and Eng-Gr </h5>
The Greek Word Search is linked with the Morphological Analysis, the
Greek-English Lexicon, and the English-Greek Word List. <p>
<t>	Click Analyze, Define, or Eng-Gr while text is selected to
activate any of the corresponding tools.<p>
Note that a lemma cannot be analyzed with the Morphological Analysis tool.
<h5>
Look For Word</h5>
<t>	Click the "Look for" field to make the insertion point
appear.<p>

characters or compound verbs) by holding the mouse button down on the pop-up
menu that shows the current type of search. Release the mouse button on your
choice.<p>
A search by word specifies a search for a complete word in exactly the form you
entered. A lemmatized search indicates a search for all the forms of a word.
Perseus will automatically parse the word you entered and find all forms of the
lemma. A search for starting characters is especially useful for finding proper
names that cannot be parsed by the Morphological Analysis tool and for which a
lemmatized search is not possible. A search for compound verbs produces a list
of compound verbs with citations for reference. (The Compound Verb List in the
Philological Tools does not provide citations.) <p>

<h3>
8.6  ARCHAEOLOGICAL TOOL</h3>
Perseus has a powerful Archaeological Tool, the Object Keyword Search, that
allows you to explore themes and relations among the thousands of
archaeological items described and illustrated in Perseus, as well as among
these objects and the other Perseus resources. <p>
The Object Keyword Search, which can be selected from the Tools &amp;
References Index, is depicted below (figure 8.13).
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.814.gif"><p>
<b><p>
Figure 8.13  Object Keyword Search</b>
<h4>
OBJECT TYPE</h4>
Object Type is a pop-up menu used to identify the type of archaeological object
that is the focus of the search. The object types include Buildings, Sculpture,
Coins, and Vases. A fifth item on the pop-up menu is Objects, which specifies
all objects in a very expansive search.<p>
<t>	Hold the mouse button down on the Object Type pop-up menu and
release it on your choice.
<h4>
CLASS</h4>
Class is a pop-up menu used to identify the class of keywords that relate to
the selected object type. The classes of keywords depend on the object type. As
an example, the classes of keywords for Vases are listed below.<p>
	Actions 			Vase Shapes<p>
	Attributes 			Weapons<p>
	Buildings 			Animals<p>
	Geographical Contexts 	Generic Scenes<p>
	Iconographic Subjects		Mythological Scenes<p>
	Athletics			Plants<p>
	Clothing 			Divinities<p>
	Food				Generic People<p>
	Furniture			Legendary People<p>
	Musical Instruments 		Historical People<p>
	Objects 			Show All<p>
<p>
<t>	Hold the mouse button down on the Class pop-up menu and release
it on your choice.
<h4>
KEYWORDS</h4>
When you have chosen an Object Type and a Class, a list of keywords appears in
the field at the top right of the display. This list changes as you change the
Class and Object Type choices.<p>
<t>	Click a keyword to activate the search.<p>
Perseus searches for archaeological objects of the selected type that have the
selected keyword in their database description.<p>
When the search has been activated, the phrase "having to do with" is placed in
a text field below the Class pop-up menu. This field is a reminder for the last
keyword searched.
<h4>
SEARCH RESULTS</h4>
Search results are displayed in three columns, each headed by a pop-up menu
that indicates the attributes of the object. With the pop-up menus you can
change the display of attributes of a list of objects and see the attributes
more quickly than by looking at each object separately in the Art &amp;
Archaeology catalogs. Different object types have different attributes, as
described below.<p>
	Buildings:  Catalog, Style, Date,  Region<p>
<p>
Sculpture:  Catalog Number, Title, Material, Type, Context, Associated
Building, Sculptor, Period, Style<p>
<p>
Coins:  Catalog Number, Mint, Region, Issuing Authority, Metal, Denomination<p>
<p>
Vases:  Catalog Number, Ware, Shape, Painter, Potter, Context, Period<p>
<p>
The results of a search for any object are displayed in a default column format
composed of the first three items in the above list of attributes. For example,
the results of a keyword search for Coins are, by default, displayed in columns
listing Catalog Number, Mint, and Region.<p>
You can see different attributes for a keyword search by using the pop-up menu
at the head of each column.<p>
<t>	Choose Vases from the pop-up menu for Object Type.<p>
<t>	Choose Mythological Scenes from the pop-up menu for Class.<p>
<t>	Click Achilles and Penthesilea to activate the search.<p>
The search results are displayed in three columns, showing Catalog Number,
Ware, and Shape, respectively. To see the same search but with a different
attribute selected, change one of the column choices.<p>
In this example, three vases are listed.<p>
<t>	Choose Painter from the pop-up menu in the second column.<p>
After a brief interval, the second column replaces its original list of wares
with a list of the painters of the three vases.<p>
<t>	Click a vase to go directly to the catalog containing the
summary and description for this object.<p>
As described in chapter 5, "Art &amp; Archaeology," the Pottery Description
(and other archaeological catalog entries) provides information about the
object and provides access to  digitized or videodisc images of the object.
