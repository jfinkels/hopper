CHAPTER 9: UTILITIES</h2>
Four utilities allow you to customize your Perseus configuration and record
your exploration and findings. Use Settings to configure the display of images
and text and the location of Perseus files on your hard drive. Use the Notebook
utility to record your notes or to annotate Perseus resources for others. Use
the Paths utility to create and follow paths through Perseus. Use the Current
Assignment utility to add your own HyperCard stack to Perseus.
<h3>
9.1  SETTINGS</h3>
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.91.gif"><p>
You have access to the Settings utility from the Perseus Gateway. The Settings
requirements involve choosing to see digitized images, video still-frames, or
both; selecting a videodisc player (if used); configuring the primary text
display; identifying the location of Perseus files on your hard drive; and
setting up a Home Card for easy access to Perseus.<p>
If you are using a locked version of the Perseus Gateway (indicated by a small
lock icon at the far right of the menu bar), your changes to the Settings will
not be saved. If the Perseus stacks are shared among several people and the
Perseus Gateway is not locked, any user may change the Settings.<p>
<t>	Click the Settings icon on the Perseus Gateway.<p>
The Perseus Settings Card appears (figure 9.1).
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.92.gif"><p>
<b><p>
Figure 9.1  Perseus Settings Card</b><p>
In figure 9.1, the Path Stack specification instructs Perseus to look for the
Path stack in the Latest Stuff on the Hyperboreus drive. Change this path and
the path specification for the Notebook Stack to the names of your own folders
and drive.
<h4>
SELECT PLAYER TYPE</h4>
Perseus offers the user two types of photographic images. One set of images is
on the Perseus videodisc. These require the use of a videodisc player
controlled by the Macintosh. The second set of images has been digitized from
the Perseus slide archive and stored on the Perseus CD-ROM. The digitized
images require an eight-bit video board in your Macintosh and 32-Bit QuickDraw
in your system software. See chapter 1, "Setup,"  for more information on
requirements for using digitized images and the videodisc.<p>
You may use the videodisc images, the digitized images, or both sources. You
must turn on the setting to use videodisc images before you can activate the
pop-up menu for player type.<p>
<t>	Hold the mouse button down on the Select Player Type pop-up
menu and release it on None or on one of the player names.<p>
If no videodisc player is connected to the Macintosh, the pop-up menu will be
inactive.<p>
Perseus 1.0 supports the following videodisc players: Hitachi 9550, Pioneer
6000A, Pioneer 6010A, Pioneer 4200, Sony 2000, Sony 1500, and Sony LDP 1200.
The name of the player selected appears on the pop-up menu. 
<h4>
CONFIGURE PRIMARY TEXT DISPLAY</h4>
Primary texts are displayed in one of six possible formats. If no display
format  is specified, Perseus uses the default text display format. <p>
<t>	Click the Primary Text Display icon on the Perseus Settings
Card.<p>
The Primary Text Display Format (figure 9.2) offers the six format choices.
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.93.gif"><p>
<b><p>
Figure 9.2  Primary Text Display Format</b><p>
The Primary Text Display Format is also available directly from the Primary
Texts.
<h5>
Select format</h5>
Six formats are offered. Two formats juxtapose the primary Greek text with its
English translation, in column or row format. These two formats also provide
the capability to toggle between the English translation and Notes that provide
commentary on the text. One format provides only Greek text. Two formats
juxtapose the English translation with Notes, in column or row format. One
format provides only the English translation.<p>
<t>	Click a Primary Text Display illustration to put that setting
into effect.<p>
In Perseus 1.0, Apollodorus is currently the only author whose works have
related commentary in the Notes field. If you select a text display format that
shows the English translation and Notes, the Notes field will be empty for all
authors except Apollodorus.
<h5>
Set text font size</h5>
Four font sizes are offered for text display:  10-point, 12-point, 14-point,
and a display size. The display size is useful if you are using a projection
system or if several people are using Perseus together with a Macintosh
monitor.<p>
<t>	Hold the mouse button down on the pop-up menu for text font
size and release it on your choice to put that setting into effect.<p>
The size of the font selected appears on the pop-up menu.
<h5>
Restore Original Settings</h5>
<t>	Click Restore Original Settings to restore the settings that
were in effect before your changes, if you change your mind.<p>
<t>	Click the Go Back icon on the Navigator to return to the
Perseus Settings Card.
<h4>
PATH AND NOTEBOOK STACKS</h4>
You can customize your configuration by establishing specific locations for
user paths and user notebooks. (The Notebook and Path utilities are described
later in this chapter.)<p>
<t>	Click the box inviting you to "Click here" to change the Path
Stack.<p>
A directory dialog box appears that you can use to identify the file location
of the Path stack. Repeat the procedure for the Notebook stack. <p>
The original Perseus software contains Path and Notebook stacks. The Path and
Notebook stacks can be shared if the stacks are locked. Sharing these stacks
may be useful if several people will be using Perseus simultaneously. For
example, an instructor could create shared Path and Notebook stacks for use by
students in a class. When the stacks are locked, however, users cannot make
permanent changes to the stacks. <p>
You may wish to copy and rename the Path and Notebook stacks to create custom
paths and notebooks. By renaming these stacks, you can distinguish your Paths
and Notebooks from those of other users. If several people are using Perseus at
one time, a stack being used by more than one person cannot be changed. Being
able to change and annotate the Path and Notebook stacks is very important if
you use these features. Copy and rename these stacks as part of your software
installation.
<h4>
WINDOW CONTROL</h4>
Perseus can be set up to go either to cards in a new window or to cards in the
same window. Going to cards in a new window means that when you go to a new
card, your previous location in Perseus remains on the screen in a window
behind the new window. If you exceed the number of open windows allowed by your
system's memory, a dialog box will ask you to close some of the windows. Going
to cards in the same window means that your previous location in Perseus  is
replaced by the card of the new location.<p>
Either setting can be temporarily reversed by pressing the Shift key while
clicking the mouse or choosing a menu item. For example, as you read a primary
text you may wish to analyze a word while keeping your primary text location in
a background window. If the settings are to go to cards in the same window,
press the Shift key when you click Analyze, and the Morphological Analysis of
the selected word will appear in a new window. 
<h4>
SET UP HOME CARD</h4>
An easy way to ensure that Perseus will find all its required elements is to
set up a Perseus button on your Home card. Perseus will create the button and
add the paths for Perseus files to the folder paths specified in your Home
stack. This automatic installation directs Perseus to look for files on the
Perseus 1.0 CD-ROM. <p>
If several users are sharing Perseus in a file server configuration, each
user's Home card must specify the location of centrally used Perseus files. If
you eventually change the names of folders or the file hierarchy of your file
server, you must also change each user's Home card, because the Home card
points Perseus to its files. 
<h3>
9.2  NOTEBOOK</h3>
The Notebook is a HyperCard stack for taking notes while browsing through
Perseus. The original Perseus software includes a Notebook stack that you
should copy and rename to create as many personal Notebooks as you like. Until
you change it, the Notebook in effect is the one specified under the Settings
utility. <p>
Each Notebook has a Notebook Index that lists the cards in that Notebook. Like
any other Perseus card, Note cards can be added to a Path. <p>
<t>	Choose Notebook from the Perseus Menu.<p>
If you have not been using the Notebook when you choose this menu item, the
Notebook Index appears (figure 9.3). If you have already used a Notebook, the
most recent Note card in the current Notebook appears.
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.94.gif"><p>
<b><p>
Figure 9.3  Notebook Index</b>
<h4>
NOTEBOOK INDEX </h4>
The Notebook Index contains a list of the names of all Note cards in your
Notebook stack. You can see all your Note cards from this Index. You can also
create new notes, rename notes, or delete notes. The buttons at the upper
right-hand corner of the Notebook Index provide access to four utilities:
Rename Note, Delete Note, Go to Note, and New Note.
<h5>
Rename Note</h5>
<t>	Click once on a note to select it. <p>
<t>	Click Rename Note. <p>

You should now be looking at a new card whose name is Note, followed by the
time and date this card was created. If a Note name was selected when you
clicked this button, the selection will be ignored.<p>
The name of the Note is selected when you first see the card. You can change
the name to indicate its contents simply by typing a new name. 
<h4>
NOTE CARD</h4>
A typical Note card is depicted below (figure 9.4). Each Note card can contain
up to approximately 350 words. Three utilities are available in the upper
right-hand corner: Note Index, New Note, and Delete Note.

<t>	Use the text select tool to change the text display.<p>
<t>	Choose the font and style you desire from the Font and Style
menus.
<h3>
9.3  PATHS</h3>
A path is a sequence of locations in Perseus. Any Perseus card or selection on
a Perseus card can be considered a location. A Path card shows all the
locations in a given path, in sequential order, reading from left to right; the
first location is in the upper left-hand corner of the card, the last in the
lower right. Each path location is represented by an icon indicating the
Perseus resource in which that location is found. <p>
The Perseus Path stack is designed so that each user can create and save new
paths as well as follow previously saved paths. (The Path stack must be on the
user's hard drive, not the CD-ROM, for any changes to be recorded.) The Path
stack in effect during any session of Perseus is the one specified under
Settings, until you change it through the Settings utility. This section
describes how to create a path and other features of paths. 
<h4>
HOW TO USE PATHS</h4>
<h5>
Use the Path Icon on the Navigator</h5>
There are two ways to use the path features in Perseus: through the Path icon
on the Navigator and through the Path items on the Perseus Menu. The active
points on the Path icon are depicted below (figure 9.5). If you are currently
walking a path, you can move forward and back on it using the arrows on the
Path icon (the meander) on the Navigator. You can also add a location to a path
by clicking the center of the meander on the Navigator. 
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.96.gif"><p>
<b><p>
             Figure 9.5  Path icon (the meander)</b><p>
<t>	When you are walking a path, click the left arrow on the Path
icon to go to the previous Path location.<p>
<t>	Click the right arrow on the Path icon to go to the next Path
location.<p>
As you walk a path, you may choose to investigate something that causes you to
leave your location on the path. If you decide to add the new location to the
path, follow the instructions below.<p>
<t>	Click the center of the Path icon to add your location to the
current path.<p>
A dialog box appears asking you to name this "footprint" or path location.<p>
<t>	Type a name and click OK.<p>
This footprint is added to the card of the current path.
<h5>
Use the Path Items from the Perseus Menu</h5>
The four Path items on the Perseus Menu provide another way to use the path
features. Add a new location to a path by choosing Add to Path from the Perseus
Menu. Go to your current Path card by choosing Current Path Card. Go to the
Path Index by choosing Path Index, or use another path without going through
the Path Index by choosing Change Path. 
<h6>
Add to Path</h6>
<t>	Choose Add to Path from the Perseus Menu to add this location
to a path.<p>
Any Perseus card or a selection on a Perseus card can be added to the Path.<p>
A dialog box appears asking you to name this "footprint" or path location.<p>
<t>	Type a name and click OK.<p>
This footprint is added to the card of the current path .
<h6>
Current Path Card </h6>
<t>	Choose Current Path Card from the Perseus Menu to see the Path
card containing the current path.
<h6>
Path Index </h6>
<t>	Choose Path Index from the Perseus Menu to go to the Path Index.
<h6>
Change Path</h6>
<t>	Choose Change Path from the Perseus Menu to change the current
path.<p>
This menu item bypasses the Path Index. A dialog box appears that lists the
Paths in your current Path stack. Click the name of the path you wish to
follow. <p>
<p>
<t>	Choose Path Index from the Perseus Menu.<p>
The Path Index for the current path appears (figure 9.6).
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.97.gif"><p>
<b><p>
Figure 9.6  Path Index</b>
<h4>
PATH INDEX </h4>
The Path Index lists the names of all the paths in your current Path stack. You
can see your Paths from this Index. You can also create new paths, rename
paths, or delete paths. The buttons at the upper right-hand corner of the Path
Index provide four utilities: Rename Path, Delete Path, Go to Path, and New
Path.
<h5>
Rename Path</h5>
<t>	Click once on a path to select it. <p>
<t>	Click Rename Path. <p>
A dialog box appears requesting you to name the path.<p>
<t>	Type a new name for the path and click OK. 
<h5>
Delete Path</h5>
<t>	Click once on a Path to select it. <p>
<t>	Click Delete Path. <p>
A dialog box appears requesting you to confirm the deletion of the Path.<p>
<t>	Click Delete if you wish to delete the Path. If you have
changed your mind or made a mistake, click Don't Delete. 
<h5>
Go to Path</h5>
<t>	Click once on a path to select it. <p>
<t>	Click Go to Path. <p>
You can also go directly to a path by double-clicking it on the Path Index.
<h5>
New Path</h5>
<t>	Click New Path. <p>
You should now be looking at a new card whose name is Path, followed by the
time and date this card was created. If a path name was selected when you
clicked this button, the selection will be ignored.<p>
The name of the Path is selected when you first see the card. You can change
the name to indicate its contents simply by typing a new name. 
<h4>
PATH CARD</h4>
The Path card provides access to every location in the path. On this card you
may also rename, delete, annotate, and rearrange path locations. <p>
A typical Path card is depicted below (figure 9.7). Each Path card can contain
up to twenty-seven locations. The locations are shown by icons indicating the
Perseus resource in which they are located--for example, Primary Texts and the
Atlas.
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.98.gif"><p>
<b><p>
Figure 9.7  Path card</b>
<h5>
Change the Path Name</h5>
<t>	Select the name of the path (using the text select tool) to
change the path name.<p>
Names may not exceed twenty-four characters. Paths can also be renamed from the
Path Index.
<h5>
Path Index</h5>
<t>	Click Path Index.<p>
You will return to the Path Index.
<h5>
Delete Path</h5>
<t>	Click Delete Path. <p>
A dialog box appears requesting you to confirm the deletion of this path.<p>
<t>	Click Delete if you wish to delete the path. If you have
changed your mind or made a mistake, click Don't Delete. <p>
There is a protection mechanism in Perseus that prevents you from deleting a
path if it is the only remaining path left in the current stack. If you attempt
to delete this path, a dialog box appears with the message "Can't delete last
card of protected background."  
<h5>
New Path</h5>
<t>	Click New Path. <p>
You should now be looking at a new card whose name is Path, followed by the
time and date this card was created. <p>
The name of the Path is selected when you first see the card. You can change
the name to indicate its contents simply by typing a new name. 
<h5>
Rearrange</h5>
After you create a number of locations, you may wish to rearrange them in a
different order on the Path card. You can change the order of your locations by
rearranging their icons on the Path card. <p>
<t>	Click Rearrange to put the Path card into Rearrange mode. <p>
An X appears in the check box next to Rearrange, and the three buttons to the
right--Rename, Delete, Go There--disappear. In Rearrange mode, each Location
icon can be dragged around the Path card. <p>
<t>	Drag the locations into a new arrangement just as you would
drag any Macintosh icon. <p>
	You do not have to drag the icons to the exact positions where you want them
to end up. Positions are relative. If you drag an icon below or to the left of
the rest of the icons, it becomes the last one. When you leave Rearrange mode,
the icons realign.<p>
<t>	Click Rearrange a second time to save the locations in the new
arrangement. <p>
The check box no longer has an X in it.<p>
You must finish rearranging by clicking Rearrange to deselect it before you can
do anything else to the Path. If you decide to leave the Path card or perform
other functions, the Path card will take a minute to finish the rearrangement
automatically, displaying a dialog box with the message "Have to finish
rearranging."
<h5>
Rename</h5>
Rename allows you to change the name of a location (available when Rearrange
mode is off).<p>
<t>	Click a location icon to select it.<p>
<t>	Click Rename. <p>
A dialog box appears asking you to enter a new name for the location. <p>
<t>	Type the new name for this location and click OK.
<h5>
Delete</h5>
Delete allows you to delete a location (available when Rearrange mode is
off).<p>
<t>	Click a location icon to select it.<p>
<t>	Click Delete. <p>
A dialog box appears asking you to confirm the deletion of the location.<p>
<t>	Click Delete if you wish to delete it. If you have changed your
mind, click Don't Delete.
<h5>
Go There</h5>
Go There allows you to go directly to a location (available when Rearrange mode
is off).<p>
<t>	Click a location icon to select it.<p>
<t>	Click Go There. <p>
You should now be at the Perseus card for the selected location.
<h5>
Annotate the Path Card</h5>
<h6>
About this Path </h6>
The text in the "About this Path" field in the lower left of the Path card can
be annotated with comments that are relevant to the entire path.<p>
<t>	Click the "About this Path" field to make the insertion point
appear.<p>
<t>	Type comments or instructions into the box.
<h6>
Individual location annotations</h6>
A note is attached to each location in a path. The annotation box at the lower
right-hand corner of the Path card allows you to annotate individual locations.
When you first open a Path card, this field is titled "No Notes" and is empty.
<p>
When you click a location, the title of this field changes to "Notes for,"
followed by the name of the selected location. Any notes for that location
appear in the field. <p>
The annotations for a location also appear when you are walking a path. When
you arrive at a location, its note appears in a floating window that can be
closed or repositioned on the screen.<p>
You may create or edit the annotation for a location by typing in the Notes
field at the lower right-hand corner of the card.<p>
<t>	Click the location you wish to annotate.<p>
The Notes field is now labeled "Notes for" and the name of the selected
location, for example, "Notes for Olympian 1." If notes for this location
already exist, they appear in the field.<p>
<t>	Type a path note or edit an existing one.<p>
<t>	Click outside the "Notes for" field or press Enter on the
keypad to save the note.<i><p>
NOTE: Do not click another location icon before clicking somewhere else on the
card to save the new note. The safest way to ensure that the new note is saved
is to press Enter on the keypad.</i>
<h3>
9.4  CURRENT ASSIGNMENT</h3>
Current Assignment is a utility designed especially for the use of Perseus in
instructional settings. This utility enables an instructor to install an
assignment stack into Perseus. Students can see the assignment by choosing
Current Assignment from the Perseus Menu.<p>
A sample Current Assignment is depicted below (figure 9.8).
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.99.gif"><p>
<b><p>
Figure 9.8 Sample Current Assignment</b><p>
To create a Current Assignment stack, use HyperCard to create a stack,
including buttons and fields, as necessary. (Consult the HyperCard
documentation for more information on creating HyperCard stacks.) Name your
stack "Current Assignment," and place it in the same folder as your other
Perseus files. When a user chooses Current Assignment from the Perseus Menu,
your stack will appear.
