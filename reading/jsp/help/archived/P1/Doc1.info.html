<h3>GENERAL INFORMATION</h3>
The Perseus Project is an ongoing experiment in the domain of ancient Greek
culture. Although Perseus is intended to enhance the study of Greek culture, it
also raises issues germane to other cultures. Its creators have designed
Perseus as a model whose successes can be emulated and, perhaps more important,
whose unsuccessful ventures can be avoided. <p>
Over time, the texts, maps, photographs, and essays that are being included in
Perseus would doubtless materialize without a massive project--after all,
scholars will develop these tools for their own use. But Perseus can collect
these materials and build a useable database quickly. This project pushes one
particular field a very long way so that scholars from other fields may plan
with hindsight how to integrate electronic tools into their own work. <p>
At the most general level, the primary hypothesis behind Perseus is simple:
technology limits the questions that separate individuals can ask. In Europe,
more people could, and did, study the Bible after printing made the publication
of Bibles far cheaper than any manuscript copy could ever be, but printing did
more than proliferate copies of the Vulgate. The Perseus database emulates not
so much the Gutenberg Bible as William Tyndale's translation of the Bible into
English. Our goal is not just to help the guardians of knowledge perform their
work more effectively but also to inspire others to ask questions or pursue
lines of reasoning that would otherwise be inaccessible to them. Roughly put,
our objectives fall into two categories. First, researchers of ancient Greek
culture, at whatever level, should be able to ask different kinds of questions.
Second, others will, we hope, be able to explore the culture of ancient Greece,
confronting primary materials firsthand, asking questions and making up their
minds using available evidence.<p>
The categories of information about ancient Greece are many and the kinds of
questions people can pursue even more numerous, but the mechanics of most
inquiries have much in common. Any historical account, literary analysis,
archaeological reconstruction, or document is based on evidence. Readers
examining an argument must first consider the evidence adduced and then
determine how much they agree with the interpretation of this evidence. Perseus
is designed to help readers confront specific pieces of evidence that others
have cited and then find other evidence that has not been cited.
<h3>
LIMITS AND STRENGTHS OF PERSEUS 1.0</h3>
Perseus 1.0 is the first of three major editions of Perseus; Perseus 2.0 and
3.0 will appear in subsequent annual releases. Perseus 1.0 is thus only the
initial step in a larger process, and its contents and capabilities are
limited. Our first goal has been to develop a structure that allows readers to
move as easily as possible from one kind of information to another. The
development of an easy-to-use but flexible interface is challenging. Two test
disks have preceded the release of Perseus 1.0, and enormous strides have been
made in streamlining the form and structure of Perseus, but considerable work
remains. We shall continue to refine, and to add new features to, the interface
in subsequent editions.<p>
Perseus focuses above all on primary materials, and we have tried to make the
primary evidence for ancient Greek culture as accessible as possible. Where a
traditional work has space mainly for its conclusions, Perseus is designed to
make the evidence for such conclusions available for scrutiny. Perseus 1.0
contains roughly one-third of the texts planned for Perseus 3.0 and does not
yet include the works of such major authors as Euripides and Aristophanes. Of
fifteen thousand slides collected by the project so far, only about five
thousand are published on this disc. Such major categories of art as sculpture
are only spottily represented. We include more than one thousand images of 178
sites, but almost all are from mainland Greece. <p>
In spite of the emphasis on primary materials, we have begun work on core
essays designed to introduce the general reader to Greek culture. An overview
of Greek history and society in Perseus covers the fifth century B.C., and is
linked through specific statements to the rest of the database. The Historical
Overview is the prototype for electronic essays on many topics. Perseus
includes an encyclopedia, although this remains at an early stage of
development. For such topics as architecture and vase shapes the encyclopedia
is fairly well developed, but an enormous amount of basic work remains. The
Atlas recognizes eight hundred place names but must be expanded. An extensive
timeline is being developed.<p>
Perseus is not, and never will be, a compendium of all knowledge about ancient
Greece, but it is already a tool that will allow students and scholars at
different levels to perform tasks they could not do before. The Historical
Overview provides an on-line introduction to fifth-century history and culture.
Students can move from Delphi on a map of Greece to a site plan of the
sanctuary. They can select viewpoints on the plan and see how the site looks to
someone standing there today. Students of Greek art can study many objects more
closely than would be possible in a printed textbook. Fifty or more individual
views illustrate many of the Greek vases in Perseus, and for these objects the
viewer can see clearly what lies on the ceramic surface of the pot: the smile
may be distinguished from the grimace, the fine details of a sandal or a
musical instrument may be enjoyed. Perseus 1.0 contains extensive coverage of
the Parthenon sculptures and several hundred details illustrating the pediments
from the temple of Aphaia on Aegina. The entire text of Pausanias' <i>Guide to
Greece</i> is available in both Greek and English and allows the archaeologist
or art historian to see how one ancient source describes the sites and
monuments of Greece. The most important ancient reference work on Greek
mythology, the so-called <i>Library</i> attributed to Apollodorus of Athens, is
also in Perseus 1.0. Accompanied by Sir James Frazer's notes and index, this
work allows readers to study the various forms that Greek myths took in
antiquity. The references to texts within Perseus found in the Apollodorus
notes serve as links, and readers can pursue many of the texts cited by
Frazer.<p>
The textual tools are the most highly developed segment of Perseus, and users
may wish to study the textual side to see the browsing capabilities being
developed for art and archaeology. A system for parsing Greek morphology allows
the student of Greek language to determine the words to which particular forms
belong, as well as to perform intelligent searches for all forms of a word,
simply by specifying the lemma. More important, this linguistic capability
permits researchers who do not know Greek to explore normally inaccessible
concepts embedded in the Greek texts. Such a tool cannot, of course, replace
experience with the original language, but adventurous anthropologists and
literary critics can begin to use Greek texts that have previously been of no
value to them. In a very real sense, such a tool raises the absolute value of
Greek texts for intellectual analysis by making it useful to new categories of
people.<p>
The cooperation of the Loeb Classical Library has made it feasible to
incorporate en masse enormous bodies of translation in Perseus. In those cases
where the Loeb texts stand in need of revision, we have commissioned new
translations or modernized the Loeb text. Our translation of Pindar is new, and
the translation of Sophocles is based on Jebb's edition, while we have used
Smyth's translation as a starting point for Aeschylus. In the case of Homer,
the Loeb Classical Library has already begun to modernize its text. Perseus 1.0
contains the original Loeb translations of the <i>Iliad</i> and the
<i>Odyssey</i>, but later editions of Perseus will incorporate the revised Loeb
editions. <p>
The generous cooperation of museums throughout Europe and North America has
made feasible the art history side of Perseus. Many institutions have opened
their photo archives to us, in many cases waiving reproduction fees so that we
could more fully represent their collections. Others have permitted
photographers to shoot new pictures of objects in their collection, and these
newly commissioned images permit Perseus to contain the best possible visual
coverage of art objects. All plans within Perseus have been redrawn using the
most up-to-date source materials, and each drawing is accompanied by full
references. Site photography has been donated by individuals, specially shot by
Perseus staff, or acquired from existing archives.
<h3>
PERSEUS 2.0 AND 3.0</h3>
Subsequent editions of Perseus will include major new bodies of material.
Perseus 3.0 will incorporate more than three million words of Greek, along with
their corresponding translations--two-thirds of all the literary material
preserved from Homer to the death of Alexander the Great, as well as relevant
later works, such as selected lives of Plutarch, Pausanias, and portions of
Diodorus. The five thousand images in Perseus 1.0 will swell to between fifteen
and twenty thousand, providing extensive new coverage of art, sites, and
monuments from throughout the Greek world. The Perseus Atlas will be a major
focus of effort, as we make the current tool more comprehensive and flexible.
New resources such as subject indexes and new software tools for browsing and
exploring the data within Perseus are being developed and will help tie the
disparate parts of Perseus together. The Historical Overview will be expanded
to cover the Dark Ages through the fourth century, while additional essays on
aspects of Greek culture will be included.
<h3>
PERSEUS 4.0 AND BEYOND</h3>
Work through Perseus 3.0 will focus on assembling a basic database that covers
the major topics of ancient Greek culture. Subsequent yearly editions of
Perseus are planned. New releases will not include the massive additions of
material that will accompany Perseus 2.0 and Perseus 3.0, but they will serve
as an electronic medium within which those studying ancient Greece may publish
their work. New editions of Perseus will include not only traditional articles,
possibly published also in print form, but new forms of documents that cannot
be distributed in print--for example, publications that include animation or
motion video, museum catalogs with several thousand still images, dynamic
three-dimensional reconstructions of sites or monuments, and parsers for Greek
syntax and morphology. The space of storage media such as CD-ROM provides users
with qualitative as well as quantitative flexibility. The Perseus Project
welcomes both pedagogical and research materials. Our highest interest,
however, will be for materials that advance the state of academic understanding
while also inviting access by a general audience. The flexibility of the
electronic medium makes it much more feasible to compose documents that can
appeal to such a wide audience, and many of the tools within Perseus do, in
fact, bridge the gap between general audience and specialist.
<h3>
PERSEUS 1.0 AND FUTURE VERSIONS OF PERSEUS: SYSTEM ISSUES</h3>
Perseus currently runs under HyperCard on the Apple Macintosh, but it has been
designed to become increasingly useful as future versions of HyperCard or
entirely new systems appear. Perseus has been built to evolve well beyond the
next several years, and we have wherever possible not tied ourselves to any
technique or system that will become obsolete in the forseeable future. None of
the underlying data, whether textual or visual, is restricted to HyperCard or
any other single program.<p>
The Perseus Project has not yet decided whether to move Perseus to some other
system (such as Microsoft's Windows environment). We have to make Perseus do
all the things that we want on one system before moving it to another. Response
to Perseus 1.0 will help determine whether Perseus 3.0 appears on some system
other than the Macintosh and if so, which.<p>
