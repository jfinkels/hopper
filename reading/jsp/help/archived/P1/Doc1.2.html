CHAPTER 2:  BASICS</h2>
The Perseus documentation assumes that you are familiar with basic Macintosh
vocabulary and standard Macintosh techniques, such as clicking and dragging
with the mouse. In addition, this User's Guide does not provide a detailed
description of HyperCard. Described here are the special ways that Perseus uses
the features of HyperCard and the Macintosh techniques . If you need more basic
help, consult the original disks and documentation for the Macintosh system and
HyperCard software. 
<h3>
2.1 TECHNIQUES FOR NAVIGATING PERSEUS</h3>
<h4>
NAVIGATOR PALETTE</h4>
Users can navigate through the resources in Perseus by using the Navigator
palette (figure 2.1). The Navigator is a small floating window that can be
positioned anywhere on the screen. The Perseus Navigator is always active,
regardless of the number of windows open on the screen. <p>
               
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.21.gif"><b><p>
                   Figure 2.1  Navigator Palette<p>
</b><p>
<t>	Move the Navigator by clicking and holding the mouse down on
the title bar and dragging it to the desired place on the screen. <p>
<t>	Close the Navigator by clicking the upper left-hand box of the
title bar. <p>
<t>	Make the Navigator reappear by choosing Navigator from the
Perseus pull-down menu.
<h5>
Get author credits</h5>
    
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.22.gif"><p>
When applicable, author credits are available by clicking the Information icon.
If author credits are available, a card appears with the source to be credited
for the information. To return to your original location, click the Go Back
icon, described below.
<h5>
Get help</h5>
      
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.23.gif"><p>
Help is not implemented in Perseus 1.0. When you click the Help icon, a dialog
box informs you that help is not yet available. Click Sorry<i> </i>to continue. 
<h5>
Navigate a path</h5>
       
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.24.gif"><p>
The Path icon allows you to navigate a path. This icon is a square maze with an
arrow at either side, suggesting a meander through Perseus. The meander has
three active components: the left arrow, the meander center, and the right
arrow.<p>
The left and right arrows are Path Previous and Path Next, respectively. Click
them to go to the previous and next locations of the path you are following.<p>
The meander center allows you to add a location to the path you are creating.
See chapter 9, "Utilities," for more information on paths.
<h5>
Go to Perseus Gateway</h5>
      
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.25.gif"><p>
The Gateway icon places you at the main access point of Perseus, the Perseus
Gateway. From the Gateway, you can select all major resources of Perseus.
<h5>
Go back to last location</h5>
       
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.26.gif"><p>
The Go Back icon returns you to the card from which you entered, whatever
resource of Perseus you were using. If you click this icon several times in
succession, you will retrace your past steps backward. This is not the same as
the Go Previous icon, described below.
<h5>
Go to previous card</h5>
       
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.27.gif"><p>
The left arrow on the Navigator takes you to the previous card in a stack,
moving you backward in a linear progression. For example, if you are on a
building card for the swimming pool in Olympia, the left arrow will take you to
the previous building card for buildings in Olympia. 
<h5>
Go to next card</h5>
       
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.28.gif"><p>
The right arrow on the Navigator takes you to the next card in a stack, moving
you forward in a linear progression. For example, if you are examining a
catalog entry in the Encyclopedia, the right arrow will take you to the next
catalog entry in the Encyclopedia.
<h4>
BUTTONS</h4>
Perseus contains screen areas called "buttons." When clicked, buttons instigate
a program action. Clicking a button called "Index," for example, returns the
user to the appropriate index for that Perseus resource. In Perseus, buttons
are often shown as rectangular boxes enclosing text to indicate their function.
In certain cases, an icon is used instead of a box with text. Three types of
buttons are depicted below (figure 2.2).
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.29.gif"><p>
<b><p>
Figure 2.2  Types of buttons</b><p>
Some buttons are toggles:  clicking one turns a feature on or off, and the name
on the button or the highlighted active area changes correspondingly. For
example, clicking a button called "Show Links" reveals link areas in a text
field. The name of the button then changes to "Hide Links," which is the user's
cue to click that button again to hide the link areas in the text field.
<h4>
POP-UP MENUS</h4>
Pop-up menus provide multiple choices from a button. Buttons that contain
pop-up menus are shown as rectangles with shadows. To see the choices in a
pop-up menu, click and hold the mouse button down. While you hold the mouse
button down, a list of choices pops up. Move the cursor over your choice and
release the mouse.   If you decide not to make a choice, move the cursor
outside the boundary of the pop-up menu and release the mouse.<p>
The active choice in a pop-up menu is registered in one of three possible ways.
One is a check mark placed next to the choice in the pop-up menu. The second is
that the choice now appears as the name of the pop-up menu. The third is an
action that occurs as soon as you release the mouse button. A pop-up menu from
a button is depicted below (figure 2.3). This menu allows you to set the type
of videodisc player.<p>
                
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.210.gif"><b><p>
Figure 2.3 A pop-up menu</b>
<h4>
PULL-DOWN MENUS</h4>
Pull-down menus provide choices from the menu bar. In addition to the menus
regularly available through HyperCard, two menus are consistently available as
you move through the Perseus resources. These two  menus are Links and Perseus.
The Links Menu remains the same throughout Perseus. The Perseus Menu changes
depending on your location and path within Perseus. The Perseus Menu is
depicted below (figure 2.4).<p>
                
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.211.gif"><b><p>
Figure 2.4   Perseus Menu</b><p>
Specialized menus accompany some Perseus resources and appear on the right end
of the menu bar when you open the resource. These menus provide tools,
functions, and links designed to expand the power and flexibility of the
Perseus resource. For example, an Atlas Menu appears when you go to the Atlas
and a Plan Menu is displayed when you select a site plan.<p>
Detailed explanations of the Links and Perseus menus are offered at the end of
this chapter. Descriptions of specialized menus are included in later chapters.
<h3>
2.2  GATEWAY</h3>
The Gateway (figure 2.5) is the point of entry into Perseus. The Gateway
contains buttons that link you to Perseus resources and utilities, as well as
to two HyperCard functions (Home and Quit). The Gateway also provides
information about the Perseus Project and the Annenberg/CPB Project, which
provides the major funding for Perseus. 
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.212.gif"><p>
<b><p>

<h4>
PERSEUS RESOURCE ICONS</h4>
<t>	Click the button of the resource you would like to use:
Historical Overview, Tools &amp; References, Art &amp; Archaeology, Atlas,  or
Primary Texts.<p>
In addition to the resource icons named on the Perseus Gateway, four other
icons are buttons that open Settings, Home, Quit, and Information, respectively
(figure 2.6).
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.213.gif"><p>
<b><p>
Figure 2.6  Settings, Home, Quit, and Information icons</b>
<h4>
SETTINGS</h4>
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.214.gif"><p>
<t>	Click the Settings icon to go to the Settings card.<p>
The Settings function allows you to customize Perseus to your environment. You
can specify whether you are using a videodisc player and what type of player if
so, you can select a primary text display format, and you can identify the
location of your Perseus folders on your hard drive. <p>
If you are using Perseus for the first time on your hard drive, check the
settings by clicking on the Settings icon and reviewing or changing the
information on the Perseus Settings card.<p>
See chapter 9, "Utilities," for more information on Settings.
<h4>
HOME (HYPERCARD FUNCTION)</h4>
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.215.gif"><p>
<t>	Click the Home icon to go to the Home card in your Perseus
folder.<p>
You may wish to go directly to the Home card if you use HyperCard in another
application. You can also go to the Home card to review and adjust your path
and directory specifications for Perseus.
<h4>
QUIT (HYPERCARD FUNCTION)</h4>
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.216.gif"><p>
<t>	Click the Quit icon to quit Perseus and HyperCard. You will be
asked to confirm your choice to quit in a dialog box.
<h4>
PERSEUS INFORMATION AND CREDITS</h4>
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.217.gif"><p>
<t>	Click this icon to learn about the Perseus Project, its
funding, and other support.<p>
An index of information lists entries for the Perseus Project and
Annenberg/CPB, support information for using Perseus, and projects related to
Perseus.
<h3>
2.3 WINDOWS</h3>
Perseus uses the HyperCard features of multiple and scroll windows.
<h4>
MULTIPLE WINDOWS</h4>
Perseus can display multiple windows, which means that you can have more than
one Perseus stack open on the desktop at any  time. 
<h5>
Open another window</h5>
<t>	Hold down the Shift key while you click to go to a new card.<p>
An option in Settings allows you to choose to go either to cards in a new
window, thus leaving the old window in the background on the screen, or to
cards in the same window, thus replacing the current screen display. The
advantage of opening cards in new windows is that you can view several things
at once. <i><p>
NOTE: You may specify in the Perseus Settings if you wish to go to cards in a
new window or in the same window by default. Depressing the Shift key during
any action will reverse the choice specified on the Settings card.</i>
<h5>
Make a window active</h5>
<t>	Click anywhere on a window to make it active.<p>
Only one window is active at any time. The active window is shown on top of
other windows and has a striped title bar. Inactive windows have plain white
title bars. Although you can open several windows, available RAM restricts the
number of windows that can be open at any time. If you open too many windows,
the application will spontaneously quit. <p>
Only windows from different stacks can be seen at the same time; you cannot
have two windows from the same stack open simultaneously. 
<h5>
Close windows</h5>
<t>	Click the close box in the upper left-hand corner of the title
bar.<p>
Open windows can accumulate on and clutter the desktop. Close any windows you
are not using. When only one Perseus window is open, its title bar will not
have a close box.
<h4>
SCROLL WINDOW</h4>
Scroll windows (figure 2.7) allow you to resize windows and to move around
windows that are bigger than the desktop (for example, the Regional Maps in the
Atlas and the Large Composite Site Plans). On nine-inch screens, other windows
may also have a scroll window. The black rectangle in the middle of the scroll
window outlines the region of the window currently displayed. <b><p>
			
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.218.gif">
		
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.219.gif"><p>
	Figure 2.7  Scroll windows with Pointer Hand and with Black Rectangle</b>
<h5>
Move around the window</h5>
<t>	Position the cursor in the middle of the black rectangle in the
scroll window. The cursor becomes an open hand.<p>
<t>	Drag the black rectangle with the hand by clicking the mouse
and holding the mouse button down while moving the cursor. A different region
of the map now appears on the main part of the screen. 
<h5>
Resize the window</h5>
<t>	Position the cursor near an edge or corner of the black
rectangle. The cursor takes the shape of an arrow, pointing in the direction in
which you can change the dimension of the rectangle.<p>
<t>	Drag the black rectangle with the arrow by clicking the mouse
and holding the mouse button down while moving the cursor. The size of the map
display changes, reflecting the change in dimension of the black rectangle. 
<h4>
PHOTOGRAPH AND ILLUSTRATION WINDOWS</h4>
Many illustrations and digitized photographs are not stored in HyperCard and
should therefore be treated differently from other Perseus elements. In
particular, you must click the close box to remove an illustration. The window
must be active for the close box to appear (the active window has a striped
title bar). To make a window active, click in the title bar area. The close box
should now appear.<p>
If you use the Navigator while an illustration window is open, you will be
unable to see the effects on the Perseus HyperCard resources. This is
particularly true if you have opened a large illustration window that hides
much of the screen behind it.
<h3>
2.4 AUTHOR/DRAWING CREDITS</h3>
When a Perseus screen has been created specially by an artist, author, or
photographer, a credit box automatically appears with the screen. The credit
box can be dragged across the desktop to any location and can be closed by
clicking in the upper left-hand corner of the box.
<h3>
2.5 LINKS MENU</h3>
Perseus resources have latent links. Links are implemented through buttons,
text, and the Links Menu (figure 2.8). Using the Links Menu, you can  move
among the Perseus resources without returning to the Gateway. <p>
                           
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.220.gif"><b><p>
Figure 2.8  Links Menu</b>
<h4>
ENTER DESTINATION</h4>
When you have become familiar with specific references in Perseus, you may wish
to go directly to those references, bypassing the Gateway and indexes. The
Destination feature offers a shortcut directly to primary text references,
archaeological catalog entries, maps, and articles.<p>
<t>	Choose Enter Destination from the Links Menu.<p>
A small floating window appears with a cursor.    <p>
<t>	Type the destination in the floating window.<p>
<t>	Choose from the Links Menu the resource that Perseus should
search for the item.<p>
When you use the Destination window to go directly to a primary text reference,
you must use specific abbreviations and formats. The standard abbreviations for
primary text references are listed in appendix C.<p>
When you use the Destination window to go directly to a catalog for
architecture, coins, sculpture, sites, or vases, you must use the exact title
of the catalog entry. <p>
When you use the Destination window to go directly to the Atlas or
Encyclopedia, you must type the exact site or article name. Be aware that
spellings of proper nouns are not always consistent. For example, Gnossus,
Knossos, and Knossus all refer to the same site. Although efforts have been
made to standardize references as much as possible, you may need to try
alternate spellings if a link fails.
<h4>
GO TO A NEW PERSEUS RESOURCE</h4>
<t>	Hold the mouse button down on the Links Menu, and release the
mouse on your choice. 
<h4>
OPEN A LINKS MENU ITEM IN A NEW WINDOW</h4>
<t>	Hold the Shift key down while releasing the mouse on an item in
the Links Menu. <p>
The information appears in a new window.
<h3>
2.6 PERSEUS MENU</h3>
The Perseus Menu (figure 2.9) is always available from the menu bar in Perseus.
The Perseus Menu allows you to control Perseus tools and facilitates navigation
and Paths. <p>
           
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.221.gif"><b><p>

Index.<p>
You first must set up a path for the Notebook by using the Settings feature
from the Gateway. Chapter 9, "Utilities," describes the use of the Notebook.
<h4>
PATH MENU ITEMS	</h4>
An overview of how to add a location to a path, see the current path card, see
a path index, and change a path follows. For more information about using paths
in Perseus, see chapter 9, "Utilities." You first must set up a path by using
the Settings feature from the Gateway for the following items to apply.
<h5>
Add to Path</h5>
<t>	Release the mouse on Add to Path to add this location to your
current path. 
<h5>
Current Path Card</h5>
<t>	Release the mouse on Current Path Card to see the path card (if
any) for your current path.

<b><p>
  Figure 2.10  Video Controller</b>
<h5>
Archive number</h5>
<t>	Click in the "Archive #" field.<p>
<t>	Type the desired Perseus archive number. <p>
All Perseus images have an archive number. A booklet that comes with your
videodisc lists all Perseus archive numbers.<i><p>
NOTE: Perseus archive numbers are not the same as the frame numbers of images
on the videodisc. Perseus archive numbers are permanent, but videodisc frame
numbers are subject to change. </i>
<h5>
Show information for current image</h5>
<t>	Click Show Info for Current Image to obtain the Perseus archive
number for the image displayed.
<h5>
Caption and credits</h5>
The caption and credits (if applicable) are shown for the current image on the
videodisc.
<h5>
Player control buttons</h5>
The videodisc player can be controlled remotely from the computer by using
these buttons. In order from left to right, their functions are Step Reverse,
Scan Reverse, Stop, Play, Scan Forward, and Step Forward. <p>
<t>	Click Stop and Play to stop and play the videodisc,
respectively. <p>
<t>	Hold the mouse down on the Step and Scan buttons to continue a
step or scan action. Release the mouse when the desired image is found.
<h4>
STACKS CURRENTLY OPEN</h4>
At the bottom of the Perseus Menu is a list of all open Perseus stacks, if any
stacks other than the Gateway are open. (Figure 2.9 does not reflect any other
open Perseus stacks.) Selecting a stack from this list brings you to the first
card in that stack.<p>
<t>	Release the mouse on the name of an open stack to bring you to
the first card in that stack.<p>
Use this menu feature especially if you are using Perseus on a system that has
a small monitor. Note that this feature takes you to the first card in a stack
rather than the last card you were on when you left it.
