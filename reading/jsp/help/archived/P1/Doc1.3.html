CHAPTER 3: TOURING PERSEUS</h2>
Familiarity with Perseus resources and navigation may be best gained in
context. Two guided tours demonstrate walks through Perseus. Tour 1 focuses on
the Sanctuary of Aphaia, its environs, and related artifacts. The tour
concentrates on art and archaeology in Perseus, with some crossover to such
other resources as the Atlas, the Encyclopedia, and an ancient text. Tour 2
focuses on primary texts and Prometheus as a character in literature. It
includes an investigation of constraint as a concept in Aeschylus and concludes
by glancing at archaeological information about theaters in ancient Greece. <p>
Both tours are recorded in a Perseus Path that can be selected from the Path
Index. When you use a Path to follow the guided tours, Perseus will function as
an autopilot; once you have selected one of the guided tours as the current
path, you simply click the right arrow of the Path icon on the Navigator to
progress through the footprints of the path. The only skills needed for the
guided tours are the ability to select a path and the ability to click the
right arrow on the Path icon.
<h3>
3.1  USING THE GUIDED TOURS</h3>
The guided tours are stored on the Path stack, which should have been copied to
the Perseus folder on your hard drive during installation. As described in the
set-up procedure, you may wish to copy and rename the Path stack to maintain
your own version of it. In addition, clicking the Settings icon on the Gateway
will identify the location and exact name of your Path stack on your hard
drive. <p>
As you move through the tours, each new location is accompanied by a small note
that appears in a separate floating window. You can reposition this note window
on your screen or close it by clicking the box in its upper left-hand corner.
The notes indicate features of the current card and your location in the guided
tour.<p>
Remember: If you are ever lost or unsure of your location on a path, two
procedures can help you regain your sense of navigation. One is to click the
left arrow of the Path icon on the Navigator to retrace your steps on the
current path. The second is to choose, from the Perseus Menu, the Current Path
Card option. This card shows a layout of the path. You can select any location
on this layout, see its corresponding notes, and go directly to the path
location.
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.31.gif"><p>
 		This icon is the Path icon, with its Path Previous and Path Next arrows
(left and right arrows, respectively). Use the Path Next arrow on the Navigator
to move to the next path location. (Path locations are often referred to as
footprints.)  Experiment as much as you like when you are on each path
location. Clicking the Path Previous or Path Next arrows will always move you
to the previous or next footprint on the path. 
<img src="/img/help/Doc1.32.gif"><p>
		This icon is the Perseus icon. In the guided tours, the Perseus icon
indicates that you can follow the locations of the guided tour but get there
yourself instead of using the Path icon on the Navigator. In effect, it means
the tour is under  manual control instead of autopilot.<p>
<t>	Under the Perseus pull-down menu, release the mouse button on
Path Index.<p>
The Path Index appears, listing the two guided tours. 
<h3>
3.2  GUIDED TOUR 1</h3>
Tour 1 focuses on the Sanctuary of Aphaia, its environs, and related
artifacts.<p>
<t>	When you are on the Path Index, click the title of Tour 1 once
to select it.<p>
<t>	Click Go To Path in the upper right-hand corner to begin
walking this path.<p>
The Path Card for this guided tour appears in figure 3.1. It provides a brief
overview of the stops in this tour.

 FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINT TO STOP 15</h4>
Both East and West pediments of the Temple of Aphaia depicted the same scene,
but they were carved perhaps a decade apart at a time when Greek sculpture was
undergoing radical transformations. There are great stylistic and compositional
differences between the two pediments, so the tour has stopped at the
description of the East Pediment of the temple.<p>
A text reference appears in the description. This example shows how Perseus can
help you explore the relations between art and archaeological objects and
primary texts. The next stop brings you directly to this text reference.

This stop on the tour offers a way to examine and compare the figure of Athena
(figure 1) on the East and West pediments. Look at the front view of the upper
figure by clicking the view. If you are using digitized images, do not close
the image--the next footprint takes you to Athena of the East Pediment (E1) for
comparison.

You have read the summary of the E1 figure of Athena and have seen an image of
it. Now you can compare the figure on the East Pediment to the corresponding
figure on the West Pediment by choosing to see the head and shoulder frontal
view, or other views as desired. Compare the figures of Athena from the two
pediments by examining their pose, movement, clothing, and any other features
in which you are interested. Rearrange the images on your screen to permit
comparisons, then continue this path.

Now that you have examined the E1 figure in comparison with the W1 figure of
Athena, read the description of the E1 figure, which states, "The whole recalls
the figure of Athena on the krater in Boston by the Tyszkiewicz Painter (Boston
97.368), as Ohly observed." The catalog citation refers to a vase in the
collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Perseus contains a catalog entry
and views of this vase, as the next footprint demonstrates.

The path woven through the Perseus resources began with the site of Aegina,
Sanctuary of Aphaia. Perhaps you have become intrigued by a particular theme,
such as the images of Athena on archaeological objects. The Keyword Search
enables you to sort the archaeological evidence in Perseus by object type,
class, and keyword. Here, try selecting Vases as the object type and Divinities
as the class, then clicking Athena in the keywords. The results show that
several other vases depict Athena. Examine the other attributes of the pop-up
menus above each column of results, then try clicking a vase in the results to
go directly to that vase's catalog summary.

that the date of <i>Prometheus Bound</i> is 453, whereas the dates given for
Aeschylus are 524/5 to 456/5 B.C. To learn the reason for this discrepancy, the

The Encyclopedia entry for Prometheus is derived from the Loeb Classical
Library editions of Herodotus and Apollodorus. As a result, there are a number
of references to texts by these authors. These indexes provide more than simple
text locations, however; they also provide small pieces of information about
the topic. Read these glosses as a brief outline of the deeds of Prometheus.<p>
The text references to Herodotus follow the format of all other Perseus
references to works by Herodotus: the abbreviated author's name and book and
chapter numbers. The text references to works by Apollodorus derived from the
Loeb Classical Library edition use the volume and page number. On this tour,
the next stop takes you directly to one of the text references cited in this
article:  "makes men and gives them fire: Apollod. vol. 1.51."
<h4>

Chapter 7 of Apollodorus, Book 1, explains how Prometheus gave fire to mortals.
References to notes are found throughout the English translations, such as the

In Perseus 1.0, Apollodorus is the only author whose works have related
commentary in the Notes field. Click the Translation/Notes toggle button to

Prometheus delivered the fire. You will also see text references to Hes. Th.
and Hes. WD. These are works by Hesiod: <i>Theogony</i> and <i>Works and
Days</i>. You may wish to see Hesiod's references to the same subject described

the yoke of constraint that binds him. The concepts of physical constraint and
subjugation to greater force that were introduced in the opening scene are
developed here. <p>

Because the concept of yoking and constraint is so strong in <i>Prometheus
Bound</i>, you may wish to see other words that express a similar concept. This
stop shows the English-Greek Word List. According to the search, the word
"yoke" appears in the definitions of thirty-nine words, shown in the left
column. Of these words, twelve are found in works by Aeschylus. You can select
one and click Show Usage to see how it is used in Aeschylus.<p>
Now that you have gained a sense of how to use the Philological Tools in
relation to primary texts, you may wish to stray from this path to investigate
the definition or usage of some of the words used by Aeschylus, particularly if
they appear frequently in <i>Prometheus Bound</i>. You might pursue the
literary characters to whom these words refer. Experiment as much as you like.
When you are ready to resume the path, click the right arrow of the Path icon
on the Navigator.
