<p>Perseus contains images, illustrations and information about the art and archaeology of ancient Greece. The main repositories for this information are the Art & Archaeology resources, which consist of the Site, Architecture, Sculpture, Vase and Coin Catalogs. Relevant material may also be found in the Essays, the Encyclopedia, and other resources in Perseus. Each catalog is organized according to a structure based on the unique characteristics of its objects. For example, Architecture is indexed by site, building type, period, and date, while Coins are indexed by mint, metal, region, issuing authority, denomination, collection, period and date.</p>

<p>Nearly all objects in the Art & Archaeology catalogs are documented in text and pictures. Each object is documented according to the best information available. Not all characteristics are known for all objects, however, and so there are sometimes blanks. Dates identified for archaeological objects are frequently approximate. Entries are accompanied by color photographs, illustrated site plans, and bibliographic references, as applicable.</p>

<p>The catalogs are linked with one another. For example, the Sculpture catalog may indicate the building with which a sculpture is associated, and the Architecture catalog indicates the site at which the building is located.</p>

<p>The Browser provides a primary point of entry to the Art & Archaeology catalogs. The Browser searches for objects by attribute or keyword and summarizes the results of the search in textual and visual formats. From the Browser you can investigate individual objects in detail by opening the Art & Archaeology catalogs. You may also use the catalog indexes and the Links menu to open the Art & Archaeology catalogs.</p>

<p>For more information on the Browser, read its <a href="SearchTools_Help.html#Browser">full description</a> in the Search Tools section of the Help pages.</p>

<a href="#Top">Return to Top</a>
<font color="#000066"><a name="Art+&+Archaeology+Index"><h3>Art & Archaeology Index</h3></a></font>

<p>To bring up the Art & Archaeology Index, click the Art & Archaeology button on the Perseus Gateway. The catalogs and indexes of Art & Archaeology are indicated by boldface headers in a scrolling window.</p>

<p>To go to an index, click an index name under one of the Art & Archaeology catalog headers. Perseus now displays a detailed index of the resources available for the selected category of object. For example, if you clicked the top choice, "Index by region" under the category Sites, a detailed Site Index sorted by region appears. Each of the catalogs will now be described.</p>

<a href="#Top">Return to Top</a>
<font color="#000066"><a name="Sites"><h3>Sites</h3></a></font>

<p>To go to a particular Site in Perseus, you will proceed from the Art & Archaeology Index to a detailed Site Index to a Catalog window. Views, summary and description are available from the Catalog window.</p>

<p>You can go directly to the Site Index of all sites alphabetically by choosing Sites from the Links menu.</p>


<font color="#000066"><a name="Site+Indexes"><h3>Site Indexes</h3></a></font>

<p>Sites are indexed in three ways: by region, type, and period. "All Sites" is an alphabetical list of all Sites in Perseus. The example here uses the Index by Region as an example. Regions encompass cities or sites that may have belonged to different political units at different times. Assignment of cities and sites to regions follows accepted conventions for the classical period.</p>

<h4>From the Gateway, click the Art & Archaeology icon, then click Index by Region under the topic Sites.</h4>

<p>Sites and the other Art & Archaeology resources are available from the Links menu, as well.</p>

<p>When Site Index by Region is selected, Perseus displays a detailed index that shows the list of regions in the left column. On any of the detailed index displays, the list in the left column is based on the type of index selected, which is indicated by the title at the top right corner of the window, in the Index Type pop-up menu.</p>

<p>The Index Type pop-up menu allows you to display the Indexes by Type and Period, or the list of All Sites. Return to Index by Region to follow the rest of this description, which will use the site at Delphi by way of example.</p>

<h4>Scroll down and click Phocis under the region list in the left column.</h4>

<p>Delphi and Itea appear in the right column.</p>

<p>The sites are listed in two categories: Documented Sites and Photographs Only. Documented Sites means that the site has a full catalog entry. Photographs Only means that the catalog entry has only summary information, usually only region information. Undocumented sites are included to provide access to Perseus images of these sites.</p>

<h4>Click Delphi under the site list in the right column.</h4>

<p>The Site Catalog entry for Delphi appears. Features of the Site Catalog window will now be described.</p>

<font color="#000066"><a name="Plans+and+views"><h3>Plans and views</h3></a></font>

<p>Site plan drawings and photographic views accompany the sites. Large and small site plans are described <a href="A&A_Help.html#Small+Site+Plan">later</a> in this chapter. Views are described immediately below.</p>

<p>The views are digitized drawings and photographs, each of which has a caption and credit information. The views available for the selected site are listed, described by their captions, below the site summary and description. The number of views available is also displayed. If drawings are available, they are displayed first in the list of views.</p>

<h4>Double-click on a view to see the image.</h4>

<p>The caption and credits appear in the image window.</p>

<p><B>N. B.</B> Click the close box of the image, upper left (Mac), upper right (PC), to put it away if you know your computer has memory limitations.</p>

<font color="#000066"><a name="Thumbs"><h3>Thumbs</h3></a></font>

<p>You can browse easily through small versions of the views using the Thumbnail Browser. </p>

<h4>To see the thumbs for Delphi, click Thumbs, upper right, in the Site Catalog window.</h4>

<p>The one hundred and twenty two views available for Delphi appear in thumbnail-size images. Up to 16 images appear on a Thumbnail Browser page. Go to the next page by using the Page pop-up menu. Click on a thumbnail image to select it. Caption and credit information for the selected image is displayed at the top of the Thumbnail Browser window. Click on the Image button, or double-click on the thumbnail image, to see the full-size version of the view you have selected. The Thumbnail Browser is further described in the <a href="SearchTools_Help.html#Thumbnail+Browser">Search Tools</a> chapter.</p>

<p>Return to the Catalog window by clicking the Catalog button, or by making Catalog the active window. Below the Summary information is the Description, a more detailed article for this site.</p>


<font color="#000066"><a name="Site+Summary+and+Description"><h3>Site Summary and Description</h3></a></font>

<p>For sites listed as Documented, the full catalog entry consists of a Site Summary and a Site Description.</p>

<p>The brief Site Summary is displayed above the Description and lists Region, Periods, Type and Summary. The Description of the site includes, as applicable, information on its physical characteristics, history, and excavation. Sources and general bibliographic information are included, as applicable.</p>

<p>Direct links to other Perseus resources are indicated in the description by underlined references. Some references are to primary texts. Other references are bibliographic sources. When you move the cursor over an underlined reference, the reference is highlighted, turning red. Click on the highlighted link to go to the resource. Read more about how to use <a href="PEnvironment_Help.html#Linking">direct and indirect links</a> in Perseus in the Help chapter on Exploring the Perseus Environment. </p>

<font color="#000066"><a name="Small+Site+Plan"><h3>Small Site Plan</h3></a></font>

<p>The list of views may include a small site plan for the selected site. Some small site plans show the evolution of the site through different phases. The example below assumes that you are starting at the Site Catalog entry for Delphi.</p>

<h4>Double-click Overview plan (sm.) in the list of Drawings to see a small-scale overview plan of Delphi.</h4>

<p>The Overview plan for Delphi opens in a new window. Drawing credits appear along with the window. Note that four areas in the Overview plan are surrounded by blue rectangles, indicating that they are active. To identify the area, move the mouse over the rectangle. To go to a site plan of the area, click the rectangle.</p>

<font color="#000066"><a name="Plan+Menu"><h3>Plan Menu</h3></a></font>

<p>The Plan menu appears in the menu bar (Mac), or at the top of the window (PC), to the right of the Links and Perseus menus, when you are looking at a Small Site Plan. The Plan menu for the Small Site Plan has two items: you may choose Large Site Plan to go to the associated large plan, or Site Catalog to return to the window containing the Summary, Description and list of Views.</p>

<p><B>N. B.</B>An additional item appears in the Plan menu when you go to the Large Site Plans: Show Image Button</p>

<h4>Click the rectangle on the left, Sanctuary of Apollo, composite plan, to bring up the associated composite site plan.</h4>

<font color="#000066"><a name="Construction+Phases"><h3>Construction Phases</h3></a></font>

<p>On some Small Site Plans, a pop-up button appears which links to views showing the evolution of the site over time, through different phases of construction.</p>

<font color="#000066"><a name="Large+Site+Plan"><h3>Large Site Plan</h3></a></font>

<p>If you have been following the above example, there are two ways to go to the Large Site Plan from the Small Site Plan you have been exploring. The Small Site Plan is active: that means that if you click on any point in the Small Site Plan, the associated area of the Large Site Plan will appear. Or choose Large Site Plan from the Plan menu. Large Site Plans are also available from the list of drawings and views in the Site Catalog window. Double click Sanctuary of Apollo, Composite Plan (lg.) to go to the Large Site Plan.</p>

<p>Use the scroll bars to move around within the Large Site Plan.</p>

<p>The Large Site Plan contains active areas, indicated by blue rectangles. To identify the area, move the mouse over the rectangle. Click the blue rectangle to open the Architecture Catalog entry associated with the particular structure. Not every structure at every site is catalogued.</p>

<p>Credits appear in the Large Site Plan window. The Large Site Plan window opens to the size of your monitor and cannot be resized.</p>

<font color="#000066"><a name="ShowHide+Image+Buttons"><h3>Show Image Buttons/Hide Image Buttons in Plan Menu</h3></a></font>

<p>The Plan Menu now has an additional item, Show Image Buttons. Image Buttons can be displayed on the Large Site Plan to indicate the locations of many of the Views of the site. The direction of the arrow on the Image Buttons indicates the perspective from which the original photograph was taken. Move the cursor over an Image Button to select it, highlighting it red. Click the Image Button to display an image; click the close box to remove the image.</p>

<p><B>N. B.</B> Not all Large Site Plans contain Image Buttons.</p>

<p>The Show Image Buttons item in the Plan menu toggles to Hide Image Buttons, which you can use if you want to put the Image Buttons away. Choose Small Site Plan from the Plan Menu to go back to a small plan of the site.</p>
<a href="#Top">Return to Top</a>
<font color="#000066"><a name="Architecture"><h2>Architecture</h2></a></font>

<p>Architecture is indexed in four ways: by site, building type, period, and date. "All Buildings" is an alphabetical list of all buildings in Perseus. The description here uses the Index by building type as an example.</p>


<font color="#000066"><a name="Architecture+Index"><h3>Architecture Index</h3></a></font>

<h4>Click Index by building type under the category Architecture in the Art & Archaeology Index.</h4>

<p>Perseus displays an alphabetical list of building types in the left column.</p>

<h4>Choose a different index from the Index Type pop-up menu.</h4>

<p>Try the other index types to see their detailed indexes. Return the selection to the Index by building type to follow the rest of this example.</p>

<p>The left column lists building types. When a building type is selected, the right column lists the sites at which this type of building is located. The number of buildings of the selected type is also displayed.</p>

<h4>Click Bouleuterion under the list of building types in the left column.</h4>

<p>Ten sites with bouleuteria are listed in the right column.</p>

<h4>Click Olympia,Bouleuterion under the list of buildings in the right column.</h4>


<font color="#000066"><a name="Architecture+Summary+and+Description"><h3>Architecture Summary and Description</h3></a></font>

<p>The Architecture Catalog entry for the Bouleuterion at Olympia appears. Features of the Architecture Catalog window will now be described.</p>

<p>In the Summary, architectural information for the selected building includes, as applicable, the site, type, summary, date, and period. Summary information is complete in the Architecture Catalog; some Descriptions may include more information than others.</p>

<p>The Description of the building includes, as applicable, information on its plan, history, construction, and dimensions. Sources and general bibliographic information are included, as applicable. Related entries in the sculpture catalog are listed under See Also. These are indirect links; read the <a href="PEnvironment_Help.html#Linking">Linking</a> section of the Help for more information on navigating in Perseus using indirect linking.</p>

<p>Direct links to other Perseus resources are indicated in the description by underlined references. Some references are to primary texts. Other references are bibliographic sources. When you move the cursor over an underlined reference, the reference is highlighted, turning red. Click on the highlighted link to go to the resource. Read more about how to use <a href="PEnvironment_Help.html#Linking">direct and indirect links</a> in Perseus in the Help chapter on Exploring the Perseus Environment. </p>


<font color="#000066"><a name="Buttons"><h3>Buttons</h3></a></font>

<p>The Thumbs button displays the available views in the Thumbnail Browser. The Thumbnail Browser is described in the <a href="SearchTools_Help.html#Thumbnail+Browser">Search Tools</a> chapter. The Index button returns you to the Architecture Index. An additional button, Locate Building, allows you to see the building in a Large Site Plan. Perseus indicates the building by flashing the rectangle around its location blue and red. Click the building to return to the Catalog window.</p>

<font color="#000066"><a name="Plans+and+Views"><h3>Plans and Views</h3></a></font>

<p>Most architecture catalog entries are accompanied by photographs and drawings. The views available are listed below the summary and description. The number of views is also displayed.</p>

<h4>Double-click a view to see an image.</h4>

<p>Credits appear in the image window.</p>

<p><B>N. B.</B> Click the close box of the image, upper left (Mac), upper right (PC), to put it away if you know your computer has memory limitations.</p>

<a href="#Top">Return to Top</a>
<font color="#000066"><a name="Sculpture"><h2>Sculpture</h2></a></font>

<p>Sculpture is indexed in eight ways: by type, material, sculptor, collection, context, associated building, period, and date. Because the available information on each sculpture varies, not all sculptures appear on each index. It is possible to choose an index type and not see all sculptures included in Perseus. The example here uses the Index by type as an example.</p>


<font color="#000066"><a name="Sculpture+Index"><h3>Sculpture Index</h3></a></font>

<p>To go to the Sculpture Index from the Gateway, click the Art & Archaeology icon, then click Index by type under the topic Sculpture. Or from anywhere within Perseus, choose Sculpture from the Links menu, then choose the item Type from the Index Type pop-up menu.</p>

<p>Perseus displays an alphabetical list of sculpture types in the left column.</p>

<h4>Choose a different index from the Index Type pop-up menu.</h4>

<p>Try the other index types to see their detailed indexes. Return the selection to the Index by Type to follow the rest of this description.</p>

<p>The left column lists sculpture types. When a sculpture type is selected, the right column lists the relevant sculptures. The number of sculptures of the selected type is also displayed above the list of sculptures.</p>

<h4>Click Free-standing statue in the list of sculpture types in the left column.</h4>

<p>Eighty sculptures are listed in the right column.</p>

<p>There are two ways to identify sculpture in Perseus: by Title, or by Catalog Number, which is often the museum's accession number or cataloguing number. In many instances, a sculpture is better known by its Title. A set of Title/Catalog toggle buttons enables you to see sculptures listed by their title or by their catalog identification. Title is the default setting; click on Catalog to change the results in the right column to Catalog numbers. Now change the display back to the Title again, by selecting the Title toggle button.</p>

<h4>Click on Agora Aphrodite in the list of sculptures in the right column.</h4>

<p>The Sculpture Catalog entry for the Agora Aphrodite appears. Features of the Sculpture Catalog window will now be described.</p>

<font color="#000066"><a name="Sculpture+Summary"><h3>Sculpture Summary</h3></a></font>

<p>The Sculpture Summary is in a format similar to the Site Summary. Summary information for sculpture includes the title, collection, summary description, material, sculptor, type, context, date, and period, as applicable.</p>

<font color="#000066"><a name="Sculpture+Description"><h3>Sculpture Description</h3></a></font>

<p>The Sculpture Description, similar in format to the Site Description, includes, as applicable, information on the subject, scale, style, condition, dimensions, and collection history. Sources and general bibliographic information are also included, as applicable. Related entries in the Architecture or Sculpture Catalogs are listed under See Also. These are indirect links; read the <a href="PEnvironment_Help.html#Linking">Linking</a> section of the Help for more information on navigating in Perseus using indirect linking.</p>

<a name="Views1"><h3>Views</h3></a>

<p>Most sculptures are accompanied by photographs, depending on copyright agreements with individual museums. The views available for the selected sculpture are listed below the sculpture information. The number of views available is also displayed at the top of the Views list.</p>

<h4>Double-click a view to see an image. Image credits appear in the image window.</h4>

<p><B>N. B.</B> Click the close box of the image, upper left (Mac), upper right (PC), to put it away if you know your computer has memory limitations.</p>

<a href="#Top">Return to Top</a>
<font color="#000066"><a name="Vases"><h2>Vases</h2></a></font>

<p>Pottery is indexed in nine ways: by shape, ware, painter, potter, collection, context, period, region, and date. Because the information known about each vase varies, not all vases appear in each index.</p>

<p>In addition to the Vase Catalog in Perseus, several previously published catalogs have been incorporated into Platform Independent Perseus, including the Caskey & Beazley catalog of vases in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; and four catalogs of American collections by Buitron-Oliver, Moon, Williams, and Shapiro. Additional Vase Publication resources include several useful vase indexes, including Beazley's ABV and ARV2 indexes; indexes to the Beazley Addenda; and a table of contents index, organized by painter, from Beazley's ARV2. Finally, plates from Furtw&auml;ngler & Reichhold have been included in Perseus. These special indexes are described <a href="#Specialized+Vase+Publications">below</a>.</p>

<font color="#000066"><a name="Vase+Index"><h3>Vase Index</h3></a></font>

<p>The description here uses the Index by Painter as an example.</p>

<p>To go to the Vase Index from the Gateway, click the Art & Archaeology icon, then click Index by Painter under the topic Vases. Or from anywhere within Perseus, choose Vases from the Links menu, then choose Painter from the Index Type pop-up menu.</p>

<p>The ARV2 Table of Contents Index displays vases by Book, Chapter and Painter. The following example will look in turn for vases in Book 1, in Chapter 1, and by the Andokides Painter. The ARV2 Table of Contents Index as it appears in Perseus does not list every known vase by the selected painter or group of painters. Rather, it contains only those vases which are also in Perseus.</p>

<p>Scroll up and down the central field to see displayed all 20 books of ARV2. This listing is structured according to Beazley's table of contents.</p>

<p>Click on  Book 1, and a list of the vases in Perseus attributed to painters in Book 1 will appear in the field at the bottom. Also the book number and title will be displayed in the field above.</p>

<p>Click on a vase catalog number in the field below to go to the Perseus Vase Catalog entry for that vase.</p>

<p>To see a list of vases contained in Perseus and described in an ARV2 Chapter, scroll up or down until you come to the desired chapter.</p>

<p>Click Chapter 1, and a list of 10 vases in Perseus attributed to the two painters in Beazley's Chapter 1 will appear in the field at the bottom. The name of the painter appears in parentheses after the vase catalog number. The chapter number and title will be displayed in the field above.</p>

<h4>To see a list of vases contained in Perseus and described under a header for an individual painter in ARV2, scroll up or down until you come to the desired painter.</h4>

<p>Click on Andokides Painter, and a list of the four vases in Perseus included by Beazley under this painter's name will appear in the field at the bottom. Your choice will be displayed in the field above.</p>

<font color="#000066"><a name="Beazley+ABV+Page+References"><h3>Beazley ABV Page References</h3></a></font>

<p>This is a special index for the Perseus Vase Catalog that allows you to access vases from a listing according to page references in Beazley's <i>Attic Black-Figure Vase-Painters (ABV)</i>.</p>

<p>Page references to ABV only appear in this index for vases which are also in Perseus.</p>

<h4>Click an ABV page reference to go to its Vase Catalog entry in Perseus.</h4>

<font color="#000066"><a name="Beazley+Para+Addenda"><h3>Beazley ARV2 Page References, Paralipomena Page References and Addenda Page References</h3></a></font>

<p>These special indexes allow you to access vases in Perseus using page references from several other standard vase publications, and they behave in the same way as the ABV Index above.</p>


<font color="#000066"><a name="U.S.+Regional+Catalogs"><h3>U.S. Regional Catalogs</h3></a></font>

<p>Perseus contains four catalogs documenting regional vase collections in the United States. They are:<p>

<br>H. A.  Shapiro, <I>Art, Myth, and Culture. Greek Vases from Southern Collections,</I>
<br>E.R. Williams, <I>The Archaeological Collection of the Johns Hopkins University.</I> 

<p>These indexes behave in the same way as the ABV Index above. In addition, the full text of the regional catalog entries is included in the Description section of each relevant Perseus Vase Catalog entry.</p>

<a name="Furtwangler+&+Reichhold+Index"><h3>Furtw&auml;ngler & Reichhold Index</h3>

<p>This index is organized according to the plates from <I>Griechische Vasenmalerei.</I> You can click on a plate to see the Perseus Vase Catalog entry for the associated vase.</p>

<a name="Coins"><h2>Coins</h2>

<p>Coins are indexed in eight ways: by mint, metal, region, issuing authority, denomination, collection, period, and date. Issuing authority is the ruler under whose authority the coin was issued. In contrast, mint is the place where the coin was minted. If the coin was issued by an autonomous city rather than a ruler, then no issuing authority is listed (it is the same as the mint). 
The description here uses the Index by Mint as an example.</p>


<font color="#000066"><a name="Coin+Index"><h3>Coin Index</h3></a></font>

<p>To go to the Coin Index from the Gateway, click the Art & Archaeology icon, then click Index by mint under the topic Coins. Or from anywhere within Perseus, choose Coins from the Links menu, then choose the item Index by Mint from the Index Type pop-up menu.</p>

<p>Perseus displays an alphabetical list of mints in the left column.</p>

<h4>Choose a different index from the Index Type pop-up menu.</h4>

<p>Try the other index types to see their detailed indexes. Return the selection to the Index by mint to follow the rest of this description.</p>

<p>The left column lists mints. When a mint is selected, the right column lists the coins issued by that mint. The number of coins in Perseus from the selected mint is also displayed.</p>

<h4>Scroll down and click Leukas under the list of mints in the left column.</h4>

<p>The seven coins in Perseus issued by Leukas are listed in the right column according to catalog number, for example, Dewing 1808.</p>

<h4>Click one of the coins in the right column.</h4>

<font color="#000066"><a name="Coin+Summary+and+Description"><h3>Coin Summary and Description</h3></a></font>

<p>The Coin Catalog entry for the selected coin appears. Descriptive information for the selected coin includes the collection, metal, denomination, weight, die axis, mint, issuing authority, date, and period, as applicable. Descriptions of the obverse and reverse sides are also displayed. Unlike the other archaeological objects, coin descriptions tend to be very brief.</p>

<font color="#000066"><a name="Buttons3"><h3>Buttons</h3></a></font>

<p>The Thumbs button displays the available views in the Thumbnail Browser. The Thumbnail Browser is described in the <a href="SearchTools_Help.html#Thumbnail+Browser">Search Tools</a> chapter. The Index button returns you to the Coin Index.</p>

<font color="#000066"><a name="Views3"><h3>Views</h3></a></font>

<p>All coins are accompanied by photographs. Most coins have two views: the obverse and reverse of the coin.</p>
