<p>The following resources are available from the Tools & References button on the Perseus Gateway: General Tools, Encyclopedia, Philological Tools, and Bibliography. The Encyclopedia and Bibliography, described here, follow the links for the <a href="SearchTools_Help.html
">General Tools</a> (i.e., Search Tools) and <a href="PhilTools_Help.html
">Philological Tools.</a></p>

<p>The Encyclopedia is made up of two kinds of entries: indexes and articles. The indexes, from the Loeb editions of Herodotus, Pausanias and Apollodorus, provide a brief gloss for the entry and links to the primary texts; the articles were specially commissioned for Perseus in the following areas: Architecture, Art terminology, Biography, Inscription, Literature, Miscellaneous, Music, Region, Theater and Drama, and Vase Shape.</p>

<p>Under Bibliography, Sources Used lists all secondary works used in the Perseus database. (Citations for editions and translators of Primary Texts as well as credits for art and archaeology are found at Author Information under the Help menu.</a>) Further Sources is a compilation of sources and materials not included in the contents of Perseus which the beginner will find useful for the further study of Classical Greek Literature and Art.</p>

<p>From the Perseus Gateway, click the Tools & References button. The Tools & References index displays the names of tools and references in Perseus and provides access to them. As with other Perseus indexes, the main categories are shown in boldface, with subcategories shown beneath each main category. You must click a subcategory to go to that tool or reference.</p>

<p><B>Task:</B> Try clicking a subcategory under each main topic. Then return to the Tools & References index.</p>

<font color="#000066"><a name="Encyclopedia"><h2>Encyclopedia</h2></a></font>
The Encyclopedia, also available under the Links menu, is composed of short articles and glosses on classical civilization, art, and architecture based on several sources. Some articles have accompanying links, views or illustrations. Approximately three hundred articles were written expressly for the Perseus Project. These articles focus on regions of Greece, biographies of ancient authors and historical figures, terminology for art and architecture, and descriptions of musical instruments.</p>

<p>The rest of the entries (approximately 3,500) are derived from the indexes to the Loeb Classical Library editions of Herodotus and Apollodorus and from the Frazer edition of Pausanias, and are so marked. The indexes to these editions were deemed useful primarily because they contain explanatory glosses for the Encyclopedia entry. In addition, it is possible to use the references to Herodotus, Apollodorus, and Pausanias to link directly with the primary text.</p>

<p>Users should keep in mind, however, that gloss-type entries are restricted to these three authors, and may not include other citations that are in Perseus. To find other citations, use the <a href="SearchTools_Help.html#English+Index">English Index</a> or the <a href="PEnvironment_Help.html#Lookup">Lookup tool.</a></p>

<p>From the Gateway, go to the Encyclopedia by clicking the Tools & References icon, then either Alphabetical Index or Subject Index under the topic Encyclopedia. Or from anywhere within Perseus, choose the item Encyclopedia from the Links menu, from which the Alphabetical Index is the default point of entry. The Subject Index lists only the articles written for Perseus and not the entries derived from the Loeb indexes. The Alphabetical Index lists both types of Encyclopedia entries.</p>

<h3>Alphabetical Index</h3>

<p>To go to the Alphabetical Index, click Alphabetical Index on the Tools & References Index to see the list of Encyclopedia entries in alphabetical order. Or from anywhere within Perseus, choose the item Encyclopedia from the Links menu.</p>

<p>To go from the Alphabetical Index to the Subject Index, choose Subject from the Index Type pop-up menu.</p>

<p>Click a letter at the bottom to see the list of articles beginning with that letter. Scroll down and click an entry in the right-hand column to go to that article.</p>

<h3>Subject Index</h3>

<p>To see the list of Encyclopedia entries listed by subject, click Subject Index on the Tools & References Index, or from the Alphabetical Index choose Subject from the Index Type pop-up menu. Click a subject to see the list of articles on that topic. Click an entry in the right-hand column to see that article.</p>

<h3>Encyclopedia article</h3>
<p><B>Task:</B> The example below uses the article for Amphora. From the Encyclopedia Index by Subject, click Vase Shape, left, then click Amphora, right.</p>

<p>Each article in the Encyclopedia consists of the text of the article, a bibliography of primary sources, and a list of related topics in the Encyclopedia. </p>

<p>The Tools & References icon is at the top left of the article, followed by the name of the entry. On the top right is the Index button, which returns you to the Alphabetical Index. The text of the article appears in a scrolling field. Literary Sources are listed in this field. References to texts in Perseus are underlined and shown in their abbreviated canonical syntax. Click a reference to link with it.
Below the text of the article are two fields: Views and See Also. Views is a list of any illustrations and photographs related to the topic of the article. Click a line in the list of views to see an illustration or photograph. If no views are available, this area will be empty. See Also lists any cross-references to related articles in the Encyclopedia. Click a related topic to see that article in the Encyclopedia.</p>

<font color="#000066"><a name="Sources+Used"><h2>Sources Used</h2></a></font>

<p>The Sources Used resource is available from both the Tools & References Index and the Links menu. It contains citations for the more than 2,500 entries of materials used in the development of Perseus.</p></p>

<p>To access the Sources Used Index from the Gateway, click the Tools & References icon, then click Sources Used under the topic Bibliography. Or from anywhere within Perseus, choose the item Sources Used from the Links menu.</p>

<p>The three buttons on the bottom take you to short entry headings in the letters A through F, G through O and P through Z. Click an item in the Sources Used Index to go to the full entry.</p>

<p>Click the button Index, upper right, to return to the Sources Used Index.</p>

<p><B>Task:</B> Make a link with Sources Used from a Perseus citation.</h4>

The Pottery Descriptions in the Art & Archaeology database show the various sources used to compile the information. To follow this example, use the Lookup tool to go directly to the vase Boston 98.894. (Choose Lookup from the Links menu, type in Boston 98.894, and press Return.</p>

<p>When you see the Catalog window for this object, scroll down to the end of the description. At the bottom of the description, click the first source attribution, Fairbanks 1928.</p>

<p>The Sources Used resource opens to the full citation for Fairbanks 1928. Use the Index button to see an alphabetical list of citations. Although you can page through the Sources Used information by clicking the forward and backward arrows on the Navigator, you will be unable to relate the source to a specific Perseus item.</p>
