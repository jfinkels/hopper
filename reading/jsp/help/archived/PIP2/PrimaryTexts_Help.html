<p>The Primary Texts are works by 31 authors in Ancient Greek with accompanying English translation. To reach the Primary Texts quickly, click Primary Texts on the Perseus Gateway. Click on an author in the list, left, then click on a work in the list, right.

<p>The Primary Texts resource contains works by these ancient Greek authors:</p>

<p>Corpora of the authors in Platform Independent Perseus are complete, except for those of Aristotle, Diodorus Siculus, Strabo and Plutarch, whose works are selected. Fragmentary texts are not included in this version, except in the cases of Bacchylides, the Homeric Hymns and Hyperides.</p>

<p>Each Primary Text has an English translation. In many cases, the texts are accompanied by notes.

translations and accompanying notes by Jeffrey Henderson. Several plays by Euripides were translated and annotated by David Kovacs: <I>Andromache</I>, <I>Cyclops</I>, <I>Heraclides</I>, <I>Hippolytus</I> and <I>Medea</I>. The Pindar and Bacchylides translations, both by Diane Svarlien, include her notes. Other notes are those prepared for the Loeb series by J. G. Frazer (Apollodorus), W. H. Fyfe (Aristotle, <I>Poetics</I>), J. H. Freese (Aristotle, <I>Rhetoric</I>), H. Tredennick (Aristotle, <I>Metaphysics</I>),  Oldfather, Sherman and Welles (Diodorus Siculus), and H. L. Jones (Strabo).</p>

<a name="Primary+Text+Index"><h2>Primary Text Index</h2>

<p>The Primary Text Index lists all Greek texts and English translations within Perseus. It may be reached in two ways: from the Gateway by clicking the button Primary Texts, and from the Links menu by choosing Primary Texts. A text may be accessed directly by typing a lookup string into the <a href="PEnvironment_Help.html#Lookup">Lookup tool.</a></p>

<h3>Primary Text Index Types</h3>

<p>Primary Texts are indexed in the following four ways: alphabetically by author (the default setting), by form (dactylic hexameter, drama, lyric and prose), by genre (Biography, Comedy, etc.) and chronologically by date of the work. Use the pop-up menu Index Type to choose an index setting.</p>
<a href="#Top">Return to Top</a>

<a name="Primary+Texts+Features"><h2>Primary Texts Features</h2>

<p>The following illustration of Primary Texts features will use the First Olympian of Pindar.</p>

<p><B>Task:</B> From the Primary Text Index (alphabetically by author) scroll down and click on Pindar. A list of that author's works appears. To select a work, click its title. In this case, click Olympian 1 [Pindar].</p>

<p>The Primary Texts window appears, displaying the beginning of the work.</p>

<p>The default display of a Primary Text is two columns, Greek on the left and the English translation on the right. Primary Texts windows contain several utilities, described below.</p>

<h3>Title</h3>

<p>The title and author of the work appear at the top of each Primary Text window. In the top right is additional title information, if appropriate.</p>

<h3>Reference</h3>

<p>The chapter and section or line reference in the current work is shown in the Go To box. <B>N. B.</B> The reference information in the Go To box is the canonical lookup string for the current author and work.</p>

<h3>Structure</h3>

<p>If the current text is in verse, metrical or strophe information is shown. Note that the structure of the First Olympian is given, with current strophe, epode and antistrophe appearing in this area. Also, the entire structural unit has been made to fit into one text window whenever practical. If the text is a forensic speech, this area may display information about its structure. If the text is a prose work, nothing appears in this location.</p>

<h3>Go To</h3>

<p>This utility allows you to go to a specific reference in the current text or in another text within the Perseus database. The location is identified by chapter and section, by book and line, or by Bekker or Stephanus number, depending on the canonical reference system for that work, called the "look-up string." A list of canonical references is given <a href="Contents_Help.html#A.3+Authors+of+Primary+Texts,+Works+and+their+Canonical Abbreviations">here.</a></p>

<h4>Go to another line in the first Olympian.</h4>

<p>Type Pind. O. 1.110 into the Go To box and press Return.</p>

<p><B>N. B. 1</B> The look-up string is not case sensitive, but you need to distinguish between the number zero and the letter O.</p>

<p><B>N. B. 2</B> You can also page through the texts by clicking the left and right arrows on the Perseus Navigator.</p>
                                     
<p><B>N. B. 3</B> You cannot use Go To to navigate to other sections of the database, e.g., Site Plans. Use the Lookup tool in the Links menu to go directly to another section of Perseus.</p>

<font color="#000066"><a name="Morphological+Analysis"><h3>Morphological Analysis</h3></a></font>

<p>The Analyze button provides access to the Morphological Analysis tool, which parses Greek words to their dictionary form. The example will continue to draw from Pindar's First Olympian.</p>

<p><B>Task:</B> Analyze the form of a Greek verb.</p>

<p>Select <font face="sparta, attika, athenian">¦ldeai</font face> from line 4 of the First Olympian. Click Analyze. Perseus analyzes <font face="sparta, attika, athenian">¦ldeai</font face> in a Morphological Analysis window, showing the dictionary form of the word and its parse. The results of the analysis can be used with several other tools in Perseus.  These tools are available in the pop-up menu in the upper right corner of the Morphological Analysis box.</p>

<p>To find the meaning of the word from the Greek lexicon, highlight the word and choose Greek-English Lexicon from the pop-up menu. </p>

<p>To look for all instances of this word in the Perseus Primary Texts, highlight the word and choose Greek Word Search from the pop-up menu. </p>
<p>To search for instances of this word near another word, highlight the word and choose the Greek Words in Proximity tool.</p>
<p>To see how often this word appears in the Perseus Primary texts, highlight the word and choose the Greek Word Frequencies tool.  To see how often this word appears in Pindar or any other Perseus author, choose Greek Word Freqs by Author.</p>
For a more detailed discussion of these tools, see the <a href="PhilTools_Help.html">Philological Tools</a> section.</p>

<font color="#000066"><a name="Notes"><h3>Hide/Show Notes</h3></a></font>

<p>Most of the texts are accompanied by notes on the English translation. (See below for notes based on the Greek text.) The notes vary in their scope and length, and are indicated by superscript numbers in the text.</p>

<p>Notes appear by default in a window at the bottom. To hide the notes for a given text, click Hide Notes, upper right. The button now toggles to read Show Notes. If there is a note on a page, the label of the Show/Hide Notes button will change from gray to black.</p>

<p>Some notes have references to other ancient texts. When these works are part of Perseus, the citation is underlined. Double-click a reference to link with it. The passage will appear in a new window.</p>
<a href="#Top">Return to Top</a>

<a name="Primary+Text+Display"><h2>Primary Text Display</h2>
       
<p>The Primary Text window displays Greek on the left, English on the right. You can show Greek- or English-only by resizing the window from the left or the right with the mouse. Resize the Primary Text window to a greater width to display unbroken lines of poetry.</p>

<p>Change the Greek and Roman font size and face by choosing Preferences from the Edit menu. Choose Fonts from the Configure pop-up menu, and click Commit Changes to make the change. For further info, follow the <a href="Gateway_Help.html#Perseus+Preferences">link.</a></p>

<a name="Author,+Translator+and+Notes Information"><h2>Author, Translator and Notes Information</h2>

<p>Full citations for Greek and English editions, editors, translators and annotators used in Perseus are available from Author Information under the Help menu.</p>

<p>For most Primary Texts, there is a biography of the author in the Perseus Encyclopedia. To go to a biography, type the author's name into the Lookup tool and press Return. Click Encyclopedia in the right column of results.</p>
