<p>Specially commissioned by the Perseus Project, <i>An Overview of Classical Greek History</i> was written by Professor Thomas Martin. It is a narrative - with links to the Perseus database - of the history of ancient Greece from Mycenaean times through the death of Alexander the Great. Emphasis is placed on the Golden Age of Athens in the fifth century B.C.</p>

<p>The Historical Overview consists of two parts, a table of contents in outline form and a narrative section. Imbedded in the text of narrative are links to the primary text sources, images, maps, plans, and searching tools that comprise Perseus. Each link may have more than one possible destination, chosen from a pop-up menu.</p>

<p>Use the Historical Overview to investigate interrelated items from a historical context.</p>

<p>To open this resource, click the Historical Overview icon on the Gateway or choose Historical Overview from the Links menu.<br><a href="#Top">Return to Top</a></p>

<font color="#000066"><a name="Using+the+Historical+Overview"><h2>Using the Historical Overview</a></font></h2>

<p>The Historical Overview is divided into sixteen major sections organized by topics within each section in outline form. Click a heading in the Table of Contents to to and read that topic.</h4>

<p><B>Task:</B> To follow along with the example described in this guide, scroll down and select topic 9.1.5, The Rebellion of Thasos. A new window appears with a text field, an outline field, which shows your location in the outline, and a button which returns you to the Table of Contents. Click the right and left arrows on the Navigator to page forward and backward within the Historical Overview.</p>

<p>Narrative in the Historical Overview is linked thematically to other Perseus resources. Linked text is highlighted in blue. Hold the mouse down on the highlighted text; at least one link will appear, sometimes as many as seven. After selecting text, you can use the Links Menu to find connections in other resources.</p>

<p>To follow the example here, hold the mouse down on the phrase <B>case of the city-state of the island of Thasos.</B></p>

<p>Links to other parts of Perseus include the Atlas, site plans, texts, and views, which are indicated accordingly. Links to primary texts are indicated by the standard or Perseus canonical system of abbreviations, which includes the author, work, and references to the book, chapter, and line, as applicable.</p>

<p>The phrase in this figure is linked to a Primary Text, the Atlas, two Views, a Site and the Browsing Tool. Try each available link in this example. Close the various windows by clicking the x-box in the upper-right (Mac: -left) corner.</p>

<p><B>Task:</B> Use the Lookup tool to make links of your own.</p>

<p>As with almost all of the Perseus resources, you can explore the relations of narrative, primary texts, maps, and images by using the Lookup tool.
Select the word Thasos from the text. (Or select Thasos from the third line of the Outline box above; blue-highlighted text cannot be selected.) From the Links Menu, choose Lookup. Because you have activated this choice on the Links Menu while a word was selected in your current location, Perseus has entered the selected text into the Lookup tool and activated it. You will see a list of links for Thasos within Perseus. Click a line to go to its link. For more information on the Lookup tool, click <a href="SearchTools_Help.html
#Lookup">here.</a></p>

<p>Another way to make a link is with the English Index. Again, highlight Thasos. Choose English Index from the Links menu. The English Index will make the search for you. Link to an item from the results field by selecting it and clicking the Go There button. For more information on the English Index, click <a href="http://SearchTools_Help.html#English+Index">here.</a></p>
