As institutions move into the second phase of these \n\t  developments, which emerging technologies show the most promise for \n\t  museums and their audiences? Which principles should form the core of \n\t  a museum's digitization strategy over the long term? How will improved \n\t  access to museum collections affect research possibilities for a broad \n\t  range of people, both in academia and among the general public?</p>\n\t<p>Working together since 1997 \n\t  to digitize an important collection of Roman art, the Perseus Project \n\t  and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, have addressed these and other \n\t  questions. This paper will focus on the development of a new archive \n\t  of photographs, and discuss the decision-making and technical processes \n\t  behind delivering high-resolution images of museum objects via the Web. \n\t  Copyright protection, storage and delivery of many large files, interface, \n\t  the viewer's experience, curatorial concerns, and other issues have \n");

Like \n\ta museum curator with limited gallery space and a storeroom full of artworks, \n\ta digital librarian is always thinking of the day, some time in the future, \n\twhen the unknown parts of the library will have their turn in the limelight. \n\tThis is why we are particularly happy to be able to present the work on \n\thigh-resolution images of Roman coins which the Perseus Project (<a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu\">http://www.perseus.tufts.edu</a>) \n\thas carried out in collaboration with the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston \n\t(<a href=\"http://www.mfa.org\">http://www.mfa.org</a>), with its curatorial \n");

Our work represents another major step toward \n\tthe electronic delivery of scholarly-level museum resources in a permanent, \n\tstandardized, flexible way.</p>\n\n      <p>The limitations of electronic resources, especially \n\tfor scholarly use, are well known to all of us; I outlined some of them \n\tin another Museums and the Web conference paper (Daniels, 1997). At that \n\tLos Angeles session, Prof. Charles Rhyne of Reed College made explicit \n\tthe particular problems of teaching art history using inadequate visual \n\tmaterials, and stressed, as he has in many of his publications, the necessity \n\tfor scrutinizing technical details, such as brush marks, or small parts \n\tof an object, like the dozens of tiny figures on a 12-foot-long Japanese \n");

We agreed that scholars, students, and teachers \n\twould not truly be able to take advantage of the electronic environment \n\tfor their work until more, higher-resolution images were made available. \n\tAt Perseus, we had always concentrated on the <i>quantity</i> of images \n\twe included, up to 109 detailed views of a <a href=\"/hopper/artifact?name=Harvard+1960.367&object=Vase\">single \n\tGreek vase</a> . However, in the back of my mind was the annoying knowledge \n\tthat the Perseus Project did, in fact, have an archive of scanned and \n\tdigital camera photographs at a much higher resolution than the minimal, \n\t640x480 pictures we freely published on our web site. What was impeding \n\tthe distribution of images of a significantly higher quality? Could these \n\thigh-resolution pictures be the analytical tools our users still lacked?</p>\n<p>Later that year, as we embarked on the Perseus-MFA \n\tcollaboration that continues today, the question of delivering higher-resolution \n\tpictures was foremost. Work over the past two years has culminated in \n");

This paper will \n\tbegin by discussing the principles which guided us, then continue with \n\ta short description of our working methods. Finally, it will venture to \n\tsuggest some of the earliest results of this work. The question of the \n\ttitle, &quot;Is Bigger Better?&quot; is really a question for you, the \n\taudience of museum professionals, art educators, and everyone interested \n\tin electronic access to cultural resources. How can these big images be \n\tintegrated into an electronic museum experience, and what potential do \n\tthey hold for the transformation of museum collections into complete educational \n\tresources?</p>\n<p>As Skidmore &amp; Dowie (1999) point out, educators \n\timplementing technology do best to begin by articulating the educational \n");
      out.write("\tobjectives which need to be served. At the outset of our work, members \n\tof the team, including curators, museum educators, technical staff, and \n\tuniversity faculty, worked together to clarify the educational goals of \n\tthis project, and, further, to express a set of principles which would \n\tapply not only to the instructional uses of the data, but also to its \n\tlongevity and utility over time. It was particularly important that the \n\tcollaborators started with a discussion of the project's objectives; otherwise, \n\tdifferences between the museum and the university perspectives might have \n\tled to difficulties, had we failed to articulate our individual interests \n\tand work together to integrate them into a single approach at the outset.</p>\n\n<p>The first, and most important, principle guiding \n\tour work with the MFA coins was the understanding that these objects are \n\ttransformative. A coin portrait of a Roman emperor like Trajan, a depiction \n\tof the Mausoleum of Hadrian, a personification of Gaul being speared by \n");
      out.write("\ta Roman warrior, issued during Caesar's conquest of Gaul -- all of these \n\trepresentations have the power to change the way people understand the \n\tancient world. Yet I am not making a special argument for Roman coins, \n\teven though coins are among the hardest to view in a gallery setting, \n\tthe most challenging for curators and educators to label and explain, \n\tand the easiest to overlook when they are surrounded by a building full \n\tof larger, more emphatic art works. At the outset of our collaboration, \n\twe agreed that the experience of seeing a Roman coin could be enlightening, \n\tand we therefore included coins in our plans to digitize the Roman collection. \n\tWe also included glass, pottery, mosaics, jewelry, portable altars, mirrors, \n\tstatues, tomb reliefs, clothes pins, pieces of buildings, and other objects. \n\tOur approach, in short, was that if an object is worth collecting, it \n\tis worth digitizing. This principle was tested by the usual limitations \n\tof time and money, of course, and we used a few broad themes, such as \n");
      out.write("\tdaily life and Roman gods, to help direct our selection of objects. However, \n\twe avoided a &quot;greatest hits&quot;, &quot;sculpture only&quot;, or \n\tother such limiting approach to the collection, as much as possible, opting \n\tinstead to represent as wide and as deep a sample as we could. The work \n\tpresented here on coins is being extended to all 1,100 of the art works \n\twe have documented thus far.</p>\n<p>A second principle was that of integration, not \n\tonly of the different sources of information within the museum, but also \n\tof the newly digitized material with existing resources at the MFA and \n\tin the Perseus digital library. Written documentation for the Roman coins \n\tcame from extensive curatorial records which had not yet been added to \n\tthe museum's collections management database, and the museum insisted \n\tthat this digitization project, and all others, should produce data useful \n\tfor their main database. On the Perseus side, we were hoping to find added \n\tvalue for the new objects by placing them in context with the other holdings \n");
      out.write("\tin the Perseus digital library, including photographs and descriptions \n\tof Roman sites, an atlas of the ancient world, and the texts of Cicero, \n\tCaesar, Josephus, and other authors. One other consideration was the integration \n\tof several existing publications of the art works, where possible, in \n\torder to avoid reduplication of efforts, and to bring new users to the \n\tscholarship already in publication. The only exception to this integrative \n\tapproach was the creation of new photographs, which were deemed necessary \n\tin order to provide consistent coverage of the collection. Many objects \n\thad never been photographed in color, or never had detail photographs \n\tmade; the coins themselves were all photographed with a centimeter scale, \n\tin order to convey their relative size.</p>\n<p>A third underlying principle was one which hardly \n\tneeds elaboration here: control of ownership. Everyone involved agreed \n\tthat protecting these new resources, by asserting copyright, watermarking \n\tdata, and attaching ownership and credit information to the photographs, \n");
      out.write("\twas important. From the start, our goal was to publish the catalog of \n\tcoins on the World Wide Web, and make it freely available to the general \n\tpublic. However, we chose to implement several safeguards, to ensure that \n\tthe pictures would not be separated from their descriptive data. In the \n\tusual Perseus collaborative arrangement, the MFA retained ownership of \n\tthe data we produced, in exchange for allowing it to be published freely \n\ton the Web. Thus, we had an obligation to protect the data, even as we \n\tsought for it a wide general audience.</p>\n<p>Several more principles guiding us in this work \n\trelated to the data collection process in a more technical way. First, \n\twe determined to adopt and conform to existing standards, for the data \n\titself and for its structuring, as much as possible. Controlled vocabularies, \n\tstandardized spellings, TEI-conformant SGML tagging, standard image file \n\tformats and processing, and compatible database structures at the MFA \n\tand at Perseus all played roles in making our data coherent, and in allowing \n");
      out.write("\tthis work to scale successfully. The curators invested their time and \n\texpertise in determining whether the quality of existing documentation \n\twas adequate, and, if not, creating new catalog information that would \n\tmeet their standard. Time spent building tables of credit lines for objects, \n\tcompiling alternate names for the same representation (e.g. Castor and \n\tPollux, <a href=\"/hopper/artifactSearch?q=dioscuri&artifact=yes&image=yes\">the \n\tDioscuri</a>, marking up bibliographic references, and employing standard \n\tvocabulary sources, like the <a href=\"http://shiva.pub.getty.edu/aat_browser/\">Getty \n\tArt &amp; Architecture Thesaurus</a>, contributed to the robustness of \n\tthe data, and ultimately saved some effort in the processes of data entry \n\tand production for the web.</p>\n\n<p>It is worth noting that in some cases, standard \n\tclassification systems have not yet developed to include the highly specialized \n\tdata sets relevant to our work; as J&ouml;rgensen (1999) indicates in \n\ther thorough survey of image retrieval systems, it is still a struggle \n");
      out.write("\tto understand how people search for images, let alone to build adequate \n\tgeneralized systems to aid those searches. An example is the <a href=\"http://shiva.pub.getty.edu/tgn_browser/\">Getty \n\tThesaurus of Geographic Names</a>, which does not yet include all of the \n\tgeographic data from the Mediterranean which would be useful in classifying \n\tthe assorted geographic attributes of the art objects, including their \n\tfindspots, depictions of places, inscriptions naming places, or the sources \n\tof the objects' raw materials. To address this problem, we have sought \n\thelp from classification schemes of other specialized sources, including \n\tfield-specific publications and other archives of ancient art, and in \n\tsome cases developed structures ourselves, based on the Perseus-specific \n\tcontent. </p>\n<p>A second, critically important technical principle \n\twas longevity of data. One of the paradoxes of digitizing two-millennium-old \n\tart works was the knowledge that they themselves were likely to be legible \n\tlong after our databases and our digital cameras crumbled into dust, if \n");
      out.write("\twe failed to make the data portable. While the Web is the immediate delivery \n\tmechanism for our work, all of the data is structured so that it can be \n\trepublished in emerging formats for years to come. The Perseus Project \n\thas a long experience in developing this type of portable data; for almost \n\ta decade, the project developed back-end data in powerful relational databases \n\tand structured SGML, but delivered the material on CD-ROMs in a low-cost, \n\twidely available HyperCard front end. With the advent of the Web, we were \n\table to take this same data and port it to a Web front end within a matter \n\tof weeks. We have also successfully built delivery software for the same \n\tdata for a platform-independent version of our CD-ROMs (Crane 2000).</p>\n<p>The last technical principle we kept fixed firmly \n\tin mind was a focus on automating the digitization process. So much of \n\tthe work necessarily had to be done by hand: the positioning and lighting \n\tof each object for photography; the review of catalog information, and \n");
      out.write("\twriting of new materials; the checking to ensure images were correctly \n\tattached to the corresponding objects. Yet in every possible instance, \n\twe looked for automated tools which might speed the process, from batch \n\timage-processing software to database error-checking scripts to automatic \n\ttape backup.</p>\n<p>Our final two requirements as we commenced this \n\twork were seemingly disparate principles that have proven over time at \n\tPerseus to be actually quite complementary: we sought to promote scholarship \n\tand also to distribute our work to the widest possible audience. In pursuit \n\tof the former goal, we adopted the highest academic standards in compiling \n\tdigitized resources; in pursuit of the latter, we recognized that the \n\tdistribution medium for our work already far outstrips the distribution \n\tnetwork for traditional scholarship, and labored to provide the interface, \n\torganization, and tools that would facilitate the material's usefulness \n\tto a broader range of users.</p>\n<dir> \n\t<blockquote> \n");
      out.write("\t  <p>The change in less than a decade from reliance \n\t    on publication solely through hundreds or perhaps thousands of physical \n\t    copies to a network reaching tens of millions of machines has no clear \n\t    historical precedent.

An audience for \n\t    these tools and documents does exist; on the Perseus Web site, we \n\t    already see concrete examples of the ever increasing audience that \n\t    electronic publication can reach.
