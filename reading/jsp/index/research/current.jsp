<h3>Research in 2008/09</h3>		
<p>
The following projects cluster around a number of themes:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>
	<a name="undergradresearch"></a><b>Enabling undergraduate research</b>: Nothing in our view offers more benefits to classics 
	in particular and the humanities in general than our ability to make it the norm for our 
	students to contribute early and often in tangible ways, large and small, to the field. 
	We can in this way make good on our promise to produce active citizens who expect to 
	contribute to their world. The print infrastructure of classics had in the twentieth century 
	grown so mature and so cumbersome that even the most advanced undergraduates in the most 
	demanding programs could not expect that they would, as a matter of course, conduct meaningful 
	research or contribute in any tangible, if small, way to the field. As we build a new digital 
	infrastructure for Classics in particular and for the Humanities in general, the situation 
	is now completely different. We can now provide our students with opportunities to begin 
	contributing in small but tangible ways at a very early stage, to disseminate those digital 
	contributions far more widely than any print publications, to allow many contributions to be 
	reused in novel ways to support additional new scholarship and to put those contributions in 
	an infrastructure designed to preserve them along with scientific data sets on which human 
	civilization depends.
	</p>
	<p>
	The section on <a href="/hopper/about/research">research opportunities</a> suggests specific 
	opportunities for students and classes but we encourage students and faculty to suggest ways 
	to contribute to these <a href="/hopper/about/research">active research projects</a> or in any 
	other way.
	</p>
	<p>
	At least three factors allow us to rethink the possibilities for undergraduate research.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>
		First, students have more and better access to primary sources than were accessible in print. 
		We have the tools already whereby we much carry much further the visions behind publications such 
		as the Loeb Classical Library and Bud&eacute; Editions, providing a range of background and 
		translation support. Scholars can now also include full citations for the primary sources behind 
		their statements, knowing that electronic publications do not have the mechanical space limitations 
		of print and that even primary sources previously available only in research libraries are or will 
		soon be available to the world and will contain links to basic background information. Thomas Martin's 
		<a href="/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0009">Historical Overview in Perseus</a> and 
		Christopher Blackwell's <a target="_blank"
    	href="http://www.stoa.org/projects/demos/home"
    	onclick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/StoaDemos');">Demos</a>.
		</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>
		Second, we simply cannot do all the work that needs doing if we only rely upon professional scholars 
		and automated systems - we need to enlist our students in this task. The projects outlined 
		<a href="/hopper/about/research">here</a> offer a wide range of tasks well within the range of 
		supervised students with various levels of Greek and Latin. Projects such as the 
		<a target="_blank"
    	href="http://chs.harvard.edu/chs/homer_multitext"
    	onclick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/CHSHomer');">Center for Hellenic Studies Homer Multitext</a> 
		have students transcribing scholia and readings from the 10th century Venetus A that have never 
		found their way into print and that are now visible to anyone who downloads the newly created high 
		resolution scans of the manuscript. Student-centered and driven annotations can provide a new 
		generation of commentaries that address the actual problems that readers confront as they struggle 
		with linguistically or culturally challenging texts. Students or classes might systematically 
		review and revise the entries for people and places and realia in digitized versions of the old 
		Smith's encyclopedias.
		</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>
		Third, wholly new scholarly instruments are now becoming available that open up new avenues of 
		research. We have studied Greek and Latin for millennia but Treebanks (see below) allow us to place 
		our ideas about Greek and Latin lexicography, linguistics and style on a quantifiable and explicit 
		foundation. We urge students to adopt particular authors or works, adding new syntactic data to the 
		larger treebanks and then using that data to conduct original research. We have, for example, already 
		published a <a target="_blank" href="http://nlp.perseus.tufts.edu/syntax/treebank/">Treebank</a> that includes 
		Sallust's <em>Catiline</em> among other samples of Latin. Students could begin now comparing Sallust 
		with the other samples while taking on the task of adding the <em>Jugurtha</em> and fragments.
		</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>
	<a name="2500years"></a><b>2500 years later in 2010</b>: the world that Marathon made: Some of the efforts outlined below are 
	inherently broad, others much more focused on particular texts or problems. As a general theme 
	for the coming year, however, we have chosen to focus our efforts on the Battle of Marathon in 
	particular and the world that it helped create in general. Our ultimate goal is to prepare for 
	a conference to commemorate Marathon 2500 years afterwards, in the late summer of 2010. We thus 
	will, where possible, focus collection development on resources that allow us to better address 
	this topic. The topic is, however, a very broad one and includes not only all of the conventional 
	classical Greek period but major elements of Roman history. The topic also invites participation 
	from scholars in contemporary Iran and raises the general topic of classical studies and its ancient 
	ties with not only the geographic Middle East but Islamic scholarship as well.
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>
	<a name="library"></a><b>A comprehensive, open source, fourth-generation library of Greek and Latin editions</b>: The first 
	digital texts contained transcription with markup representing the page-layout of the print source 
	(e.g., representing that a word is in italics). A second generation of collections (of which the 
	primary sources in Perseus provide one example) began to add semantic markup (e.g., representing that 
	a word is in italics because it is a Latin quotation). Collections such as the 
	<a target="_blank" href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moagrp/"
    	onclick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/MoA');">Making of America</a> and 
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.jstor.org/"
    	onclick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/JSTOR');">JSTOR</a> then
    	demonstrated a third, much larger generation of 
	collections where readers search text automatically generated by Optical Character Recognition 
	(OCR) software and basic library cataloguing data, and then view scanned page images of the source. 
	Where second generation collections extend the scope of first generation collections by adding 
	semantic markup to carefully transcribed text, third-generation collections reverse production 
	philosophies, emphasizing automation and scalability over the artisanal techniques of first and 
	second-generation collections.
	</p>
	<p>
	Third-generation collections focus on the quality of the page images and associated meta-data and 
	assume that the automatically generated text will improve with each new generation of OCR software. 
	In the 1970s and 1980s, when the first- and second-generation collections emerged, scanning and 
	storage technology made libraries of scanned page images impractical - the several hundred megabytes 
	of transcribed Greek from the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae  (TLG) required special disk drives that cost 
	tens of thousands of dollars. Texts had to be transcribed well enough to stand on their own and 
	readers would have to rely upon printed copies to identify errors and to find the textual notes, 
	introductions, indices, appendices and other scholarly apparatus. At least one major library has 
	informally reported that it would not accept first- or second-generation collections unless they 
	came with digital page images aligned to the transcribed texts.
	</p>
	<p>
	Fourth-generation collections integrate not only carefully transcribed text and the original page 
	images but also other forms of annotation (e.g., morphological and syntactic analysis, indices of 
	people and places, markup for the particular sense of particular words in context).
	</p>
	<p>
	The first fourth-generation texts became available at least as early as 2006, when Perseus aligned 
	manually produced, TEI-compliant editions to page images that it scanned in-house. In 2007, Perseus 
	tested the <a target="_blank"

	<a name="collections"></a><b>Focused collections on selected Greek and Latin authors</b>: To complement the general collection 
	development and scalable services we are choosing a small number of authors on which to focus 
	particular attention. For these authors, we will collect more editions and associated publications 
	(especially commentaries, indices, specialized lexica), with targeted creation of TEI-compliant XML 
	transcriptions. We will focus upon Herodotus, Aeschylus and Thucydides to illustrate classical Greece 
	and the world that Marathon made. We also have a major commitment to Homer that reflects work already 
	begun at Perseus and collaborations with projects such as the Homer Multitext Project of Harvard's 
	Center for Hellenic Studies. On the Roman side, we will concentrate on Sallust and Propertius, whose 
	corpora are small enough for close study and for which we can, for example, provide comprehensive 
	Treebanks (see below), and on Livy and Cicero, whose corpora are large enough to demand automated methods.
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>
	<a name="scalable"></a><b>Scalable methods to identify, transcribe and automatically tag Greek and Latin</b>: These services 
	include not only optimized OCR but algorithms that compare the OCR output from different editions of 
	the same work to distinguish text from headers, textual notes and marginalia and OCR errors in the 
	text from intentional editorial variations. The immediate goal is to create a searchable collection 
	of Greek and Latin that provides better scholarly recall than manually produced collections on which 
	scholars have traditionally relied: about 8% of the unique Greek and Latin words on a given pages 
	from any standard edition only appear in the textual notes (in series such as the Loeb Classical 
	Library which traditionally restrict readings to a minimum, this figure remains c. 4%). Curated 
	collections that contain perfect transcriptions but only the reconstructed text can only deliver 
	92-96% of the words that the editor chose to print.

    	onclick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/TDLOCR');">OCR-generated text can 
	already deliver 98-99%</a> of the words from printed Greek and thus immediately provide better recall

	<p>
	<a name="fragmentary"></a><b>Fragmentary authors</b>: Humanists have been working with digital texts for a generation but we have 
	in these first decades focused our efforts upon the large body of texts that survive more or less 
	intact. Most of the works written in antiquity are, however, lost - less than 10% of the works of 
	Aeschylus, Euripides and Sophocles, for example survive. Most classical authors exist, therefore, in a 
	fragmentary state. In some cases, these texts are scraps of papyrus that survived in the sands of Egypt 
	and are literally fragments. In most cases, however, our surviving fragments are, in fact, passages 
	where surviving authors quote, summarize or simply allude to authors and works that have not survived. 
	Print editions of fragmentary authors typically print excerpts about a fragmentary authors along with 
	various categories of scholarly apparatus (the editor's commentary, a translation, variant readings etc.) 
	In a digital world, such fragmentary editions should contain dynamic links that point to editions of the 
	quoting source. The comprehensive collection of Greek and Latin source texts, with scanned page images 
	and searchable OCR-generated text for all, and carefully transcribed TEI-compliant XML for some, gives 
	us the foundation on which we can build the dynamic, hypertextual editions of fragmentary authors.
	</p>
	<p>
	In 2008-09 we will begin work on the Greek fragmentary historians, using M&uuml;ller's 
	<a target="_blank"
    	href="http://www.archive.org/details/fragmentahistori01mueluoft"
    	onclick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/InternetArchiveMuller');">Fragmenta Graecorum Historicorum</a> 
	as a starting point. The output of this work will be both an initial edition of Greek fragmentary 
	historians and the methods by which we represent pointers into source works and associated scholarly 
	annotation. We will create a broad first pass at a comprehensive database of fragments for all Greek 
	authors, but we will focus particular attention on those authors most relevant to the theme of the 
	world that Marathon made.
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>
	<a name="machine"></a><b>From human-readable information to machine actionable knowledge</b>: If a lexicon includes an entry 
	such as "insula, -ae, f.," students of Latin can recognize this is a statement that there is a 
	first declension feminine Latin noun with stem <em>insul</em>- and endings with nominative 
	singular <em>insula</em>, genitive plural <em>insularum</em> etc. A machine can generate and 
	recognize forms of this noun but it needs the information about stems and endings in a format 
	that it can process. Commentaries contain information about particular passages - if we can 
	represent the commentary entries in a format that machines can recognize. Encyclopedias contain 
	many statements about birth and death dates, offices held ("X consul in Y"), kinship (e.g., X 
	son of Y), and other propositional statements. While we cannot carefully transcribe every book 
	about classics from our print libraries, a relatively constrained number of reference books 
	contain a large body of information that could, if converted into a machine actionable format, 
	drive a range of services. Every funded project on which we are working depends upon the 
	conversion of some part of the print infrastructure into such machine actionable knowledge bases. 
	We are therefore preparing to convert a range of such print resources into structured, 
	machine-actionable form including lexica, grammars, commentaries, editions, editions of surviving 
	texts and editions of fragmentary authors.
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>
	<a name="borndigital"></a><b>Born-digital knowledge bases</b>: While print reference works contain a great deal of information 
	that can be converted into machine actionable form, they cannot provide all of the data that we need 
	to drive some of the services that are most promising for humanists.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>
		First, information available in print format does not always lend itself to automatic extraction 
		- in the general case, the automatic analysis of full text is an unsolved problem. An encyclopedia 
		or dictionary entry may contain propositional statements that automated systems could use but that 
		we cannot extract from the text. Critical editions contain a wealth of statements about how one 
		version of a text differs from various others but these print annotations are hard for automatic 
		systems to decode.
		</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>
		Second, our printed reference works leave out information that their authors collected and which 
		automated systems need. The authors of lexica, for example, often have space to print only a 
		selection of the passages that they have sorted into distinct word sense - their sorted slips of 
		paper or file cards contained the wealth of training examples on which machine learning thrives 
		but these are lost or available only as archival materials.
		</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>
		Third, some categories of information do not have exact print antecedents. Classical philologists 
		can see from the emerging field of corpus linguistics a wide range of annotations relevant to their 
		work. These range from basic categories such as co-reference (e.g., determining whether <em>hic</em>, 
		"this person," refers back to Caesar or Antony in a particular passage) to more broadly interpretive 
		categories such as labeling expressions about time and events (e.g., languages such as 
		<a target="_blank"
    	href="http://www.timeml.org/site/index.html"
    	onclick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/TimeML');">TimeML</a> and the Bruce Robertson's 
		<a target="_blank"
    	href="http://heml.mta.ca/heml-cocoon/" 
	onclick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/HEML');">Historical
    	Event Markup and Linking language</a>). Even 
		as we build up treebanks with core syntactic data we need to explore other categories of linguistic 
		markup.
		</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>
	<a name="treebank"></a><b>The Classical Greek and Latin Treebank Projects</b>: Syntactic annotations record information about the 
	relationships between the words: e.g., <em>orationes</em> in a given sentence is the object of 
	<em>dicit</em> ("s/he speaks, says") and has the modifier ZZZ. Such annotations organize the words 
	in a sentence into tree-like structures and can be collected into linguistic databases conventionally 
	called Treebanks. These Treebanks can let us see phenomena such as the changing subjects and objects 
	that a given verb takes over time, sentence structure (e.g., subject-verb-object vs. subject-object-verb), 
	and individual style of particular authors, genres and periods. Automated systems can automatically 
	analyze more than 90% of English sentences but these systems do so by analyzing pre-existing Treebanks 
	with a million or more words. For complex, stylistically idiosyncratic and relatively small classical 
	texts, manual annotation would be necessary in any case, but such manual annotation allows us then to 
	place our understanding of these texts on a fundamentally new, more explicit foundation.
	</p>
	<p>
	In August 2008, we published the latest version of the 
	<a target="_blank" href="http://nlp.perseus.tufts.edu/syntax/treebank/">Latin Treebank</a>, which now includes more 
	than 50,000 words. At the same time, we began work on what will be a 1,000,000 word Treebank for 
	classical Greek.
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>
	<a name="datamining"></a><b>Text/Data-mining and the Automated production of new knowledge</b>: Once we have converted even the 
	simplest print resources into machine actionable knowledge, we can use that knowledge to generate 
	new knowledge. Consider the examples of traditional print indices and translations. Conversion of print 
	indices involves, at the simplest level, identifying the headwords and citations. This amount of structure 
	allows machines to see that there are, for example, six figures named Alexander in a given corpus and a 
	list of passages where each separate Alexander appears. A named entity identification system can use 
	machine learning algorithms to analyze the context in which the different Alexanders appear to predict 
	the most likely Alexander to which other passages refer. Likewise, if we add basic citations to an 
	English translation (i.e., this passage of English corresponds to the Greek in Thucydides, Book 1, 
	chapter 86), then we can identify words and phrases in the English translation that correspond to 
	the Greek: e.g., Latin <em>orationes</em> corresponds to the English word "speeches" in one passage 
	but to "prayers" in another. We can then use machine learning algorithms to predict in passages where 
	there is no English translation whether <em>orationes</em> more likely corresponds to "speeches" or 
	"prayers." We can also begin to use these lower level conclusions (e.g., Antonius in passage X 
	designates the famous Marc Antony the Triumvir who appears also in Shakespeare, <em>orationes</em> in 
	passage Y corresponds to "speeches") to identify more patterns that indicate people, places, word 
	meanings and other topics (e.g., what other people and places appear in conjunction with Antony? What 
	other words in Latin and Greek correspond to the English word "prayer" in various periods and genres?) 
	At this point, we have moved from patterns that human beings have already labeled (e.g., passage 
	X describes Marc Antony while passage Y describes another particular Antonius), to inferences that 
	human beings make hundreds or thousands of times a day but do not have time to record (e.g., when 
	readers automatically distinguish references to Alexandria, Egypt, vs. Alexandria, VA), to patterns 
	that no human being would see by simply reading through a texts (e.g., a survey of the Latin and 
	Greek terms corresponding to "prayer" that appear in texts containing hundreds of millions of words 
	and written over two millennia).

	<a name="adaptinfo"></a><b>Adapting linguistic and cultural information for particular readers</b>: Once we begin assembling large 
	bodies of information, we need methods to provide individual users with information adapted their 
	general backgrounds and their immediate purposes. There are two ways in which to adapt large bodies 
	of information. Personalization compares the behavior of a given user against that of previous users 
	to suggest actions of interest (e.g., people who bought book X also bought books Y and Z). Early 
	experiments showed that similar techniques were applicable for readers of Greek and Latin: once 
	readers ask about four words from a particular passage, we can predict two thirds of the other 
	words about which they will have questions.
	</p>
	<p>
	Our work in 2008-09 focuses primarily upon customized reading support. Customization follows 
	directions from the user (e.g., a user created profile that requests all new information about 
	Pericles' <em>Funeral Oration</em>). Our work focuses upon customized vocabulary profiles in which 
	we have digitized the vocabularies from textbooks of Greek, Latin and Arabic. We want to be able 
	to answer two basic questions: first, we want readers to be able to identify words that they have 
	not yet encountered in a given chunk of text and then to rank the unseen words according to various 
	criteria of significance; second, we want to be able to find passages that best match the existing 
	vocabulary of a particular reader.

	<a name="scaife"></a><b>The Scaife Digital Library</b>: Named after the late Ross Scaife, the Scaife Digital Library is 
	being developed as a distributed collection and a method whereby humanists from around the world 
	can automatically aggregate their content. The Scaife Digital Library contains durable objects 
	that (1) have received peer review, (2) are in sustainable formats such as the

	therefore to move as many Perseus objects as possible into the Tufts Digital Library, with a 
	particular focus upon newly scanned image books and existing commentaries, lexica, encyclopedias 
	and other materials not yet released under an open source license. Our goal at this stage is to 
	provide basic identifiers that will allow users to retrieve these objects from the Tufts Digital

	<a name="repository"></a><b>Institutional Repositories for Advanced Humanities Content</b>: The Scaife Digital Library addresses 
	the problem of long-term preservation for particular objects but we need services as well with which to 
	use the objects. Libraries have successfully maintained the products of intellectual labor for generations 
	and have begun designing institutional repositories that can maintain digital content. These institutional 
	repositories are, however, generally prepared to support very simple digital objects such as images and 
	lightly structured journal articles. We are thus preparing to develop for one major institutional 
	repository system, <a target="_blank"
    	href="http://www.fedora-commons.org/" 
	onclick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/Fedora');">Fedora</a>, the data models needed to 
	support the more complex objects with which students of the three classical languages regularly work. 
	These include the ability to extract reference articles (e.g., the entry on Alexander the Great in 
	encyclopedia A), dictionary entries and particular word senses from machine readable dictionaries 
	(e.g., word sense II.2.a for word X), and the text associated with canonical text citations (e.g., 
	the Greek text and English translation for section 2, chapter 86, book 1 of Thucydides). To do this, 
	we are starting to adapt the Perseus Digital Library system to work with Fedora as a backend system. 
	The goal of this effort is ultimately to release a version of the Perseus Digital Library system that 
	institutions can download as a turn-key solution for scholarly collections.

	<a name="grid"></a><b>Grid-Enabled Open Services</b>: The Perseus infrastructure has depended upon a traditional 
	architecture where we apply programs stored on local servers to locally stored texts and other 
	data. We are working with colleagues at Imperial College London to begin a distributed architecture 
	that works with services and collections from multiple sources. Such an architecture is designed to 
	allow scholars and projects to create their own configurations, perhaps substituting one morphological 
	analyzer for another or adding new modules for particular text mining or visualization functions. 
	Such an architecture also allows us to tap into much greater computational resources, drawing upon 
	services driven by grid computing and/or the services from internet giants such as Google.
