As a digital infrastructure for the humanities in general and classics in particular takes shape, 
an unprecedented range of opportunities are emerging whereby students can contribute tangibly to 
their disciplines at an early stage of their education.  New collections and services allow 
undergraduates to conduct meaningful research projects, the results of which can be disseminated 
immediately, linked to the primary sources to which they contribute and preserved in institutional 
repositories for generations as part of the core collections on which humanities research depends.
</p>
<p>
During the 2008-09 academic year, we particularly encourage students and classes to help produce, 
and to construct research projects based upon, treebanks for classical Greek and Latin now under 
development. A treebank is a large collection of syntactically parsed sentences, in which an annotator 
has specified the exact syntactic relationship for every word in a sentence (e.g., what the subject 
is, what the object is, where the prepositional phrase should be attached, which adjective modifies 
which noun, etc.) along with each word's morphological analysis (feminine singular nominative 
adjective) and the dictionary entry it's derived from (est as an inflection of <em>edo</em> rather than 
<em>sum</em>).  The following diagram represents a syntactic annotation of <em>ista meam norit 
gloria canitiem</em> ("that glory will know my old age") from Propertius 1.8.

Treebanks will be the most important new resources for the study of Greek and Latin that have appeared 
since the grand scholarly projects of 19th century philology.  On the one hand, treebanks make a whole 
new generation of reading support possible: we will be able not only to ask what individual words mean 
but also to view analyses of the syntactic structures of individual sentences.  Treebanks, however, 
also allow us to place our current understanding of lexicography, linguistics and style on a wholly new, 
quantifiable, transparent basis and to ask new questions about Greek and Latin that were not feasible 
with print tools.  Treebanks are the classical equivalent of the genome for the life sciences.  We have 
released the first 50,000 word treebank for classical Latin and are beginning a major effort that is 
designed to produce a treebank with 1,000,000 words of classical Greek.
</p>
<p>
We urge classes and students of Greek and Latin to contribute to this larger effort in a variety of ways:
</p>
<ul>
	<ol>
	<p>
	<b>Create treebanks for particular works or sections of Greek and Latin and contribute these to 
	the larger Greek and Latin Treebanks</b>: Each sentence in the treebank lists who produced the 
	syntactic analysis. These producers can be individuals or groups such as classes. In our work so 
	far, two separate annotators have analyzed each sentence and an editor has gone through to resolve 
	discrepancies to produce a single database with one best analysis per word.  Instructors can use 
	this model with classes, providing a final set of syntactic analyses that cites the students 
	individually or the class as a whole. Individual contributors can submit their own syntactic 
	analyses for review and publication. This exercise will provide a mechanism with which students 
	can think about Greek and Latin in new ways while contributing to the sum of knowledge about the 
	languages themselves. Many passages of Greek and Latin admit, of course, of multiple syntactic 
	interpretations.  We can accept data that includes multiple versions of the same sentence or 
	alternate interpretations for sentences already in the treebank.
	</p>
	</ol>
	<ol>
	<p>
	<b>Publish variant readings and accompanying annotations</b>: Some readings may have no impact 
	upon the syntactic structure of a sentence (although substituting one verb or noun for another 
	may have a huge impact on the meaning).  Other readings will require substantial revision of 
	the syntactic analysis.  Adding syntactically interpreted analyses will allow us to evaluate 
	the syntactic impact of different editorial choices between editions and thus provides an 
	essential component for true digital editions.
	</p>
	</ol>
	<ol>
	<p>
	<b>Publish documented annotations with alternate interpretations</b>: In this case, we do not 
	simply list alternate interpretations but provide evidence that supports each interpretation. 
	In practice, this involves comparing passages where the structure is uncertain with similar 
	passages where the structure is less problematic.  As our treebanks grow in size, we will be 
	able to use them to place our intepretations on a basis that not only allows for quantification 
	but is transparent:  others can go beyond the numbers and check for themselves each passage 
	on which the numbers are based. As the treebanks are still growing in size, however, we may 
	find it easier to conduct the more focused studies listed next.
	</p>
	</ol>
	<ol>
	<p>
	<b>Conduct original research on Greek and Latin lexicography, linguistics or stylistic analysis 
	and publish the results with hypertextual links directly connecting your conclusions with the 
	passages on which they comment</b>: Even a treebank with one million words covers only a small 
	percentage of classical Greek or Latin. You can build on pre-existing treebanks and/or contribute 
	new data to ask new questions that have never before been possible. The rising generation of 
	students has an opportunity to develop a cumulative set of research projects that will shed 
	increasing light upon Greek and Latin. Each research publication will be submitted to editorial 
	review and, if accepted, stored permanently in the Perseus Digital Library and the emerging 
	distributed Scaife Digital Library. This research can be as narrowly focused as "Does Cicero's 
	use of the passive voice differ between his letters to Atticus and his Phillipics?" or as broad 
	as "the use of &#960;&#959;&#953;&#941;&#969; in Greek."  Other options (to give you some ideas) include the following:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>
		<b>Lexicographical</b>: Traditional dictionaries like the Oxford Latin Dictionary and the 
		LSJ provide plentiful citations to support their definitions of words, usually with the most 
		frequent sense up front.  Are their judgments reflected in actual usage?  Does it differ 
		between authors?
		</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>
		<b>Linguistic</b>: Classical Latin has been thought to use a word order in which the verb 
		follows the direct object (SOV), but the word order of its daughter languages (like Italian 
		and Spanish) puts the verb before the direct object (SVO).  Did Classical Latin actually 
		have this SOV word order, and if so, can we chart how it changed?
		</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>
		<b>Stylistic</b>: What kind of verbs is Sallust's Catiline the subject of (i.e., what kind 
		of actions does he undertake?)  How does this compare to the actions that Cicero attributes 
		to him in his own text (<em>In Catilinam</em>)?  Is one more sympathetic than the other?
		</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</ol>
</ul>
<p>
You do not have to create a complete treebank for an author or work to generate important results 
if you create a thoughtful subset. We also support forums whereby people working on the Treebank 
can identify the passages of interest to themselves, take responsibility for particular passages 
and discuss questions about how to annotate them. By coordinating efforts, we can combine the work 
of many classes to provide much broader coverage for individual texts, authors and genres.

Bamman</a> or <a href="mailto:gregory.crane@tufts.edu">Gregory Crane</a> at Perseus. Content 
submitted by February 1, 2009, will be included in May 2009 release of the classical Greek and 
Latin treebanks.
