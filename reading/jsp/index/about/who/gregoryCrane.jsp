		Gregory Crane's interests are twofold. On the one hand, he has published on a wide range of 
		ancient Greek authors (including articles on Greek drama and Hellenistic poetry and a book 
		on the <em>Odyssey</em>). Much of his traditional scholarly work has been devoted to 
		Thucydides; his book <em>The Blinded Eye: Thucydides and the New Written Word</em> appeared 
		from Rowman and Littlefield in 1996; his second Thucydides book (<em>The Ancient Simplicity: 
		Thucydides and the Limits of Political Realism</em>) was published by the University of 
		California Press in 1998.
		</p>
		<p>
		At the same time, he has a long-standing interest in the relationship between the humanities 
		and rapidly developing digital technology. He began this side of his work as a graduate 
		student at Harvard when the Classics Department purchased its first TLG authors on magnetic 
		tape in the summer of 1982. He developed a Unix-based full text retrieval system for the TLG 
		that was widely used in North America and Europe in the middle 1980s. He also helped establish 
		a typesetting consortium to facilitate scholarly publishing. Since 1985 he has been engaged 
		in planning and development of the Perseus Project, which he directs as the Editor-in-Chief. 
		Besides supervising the Perseus Project as a whole, he has been primarily responsible for the 
		development of the morphological analysis system which provides many of the links within the 
		Perseus database.
		</p>
		<p>
		From 1998 through 2006 he directed a grant from the <a href="http://www.dli2.nsf.gov/">Digital 
		Library Initiative</a> to study general problems of digital libraries in the humanities. Under 
		the DLI-2 program, he worked on a range of topics, including such topics as London, the history 
		of Mechanics, and the American Civil War. Each of these collections provided new insights into 
		the implications of such new electronic tools on learning. In 2006, he produced a named entity 
		identification system, published a 55 million word collection, and authored several publications 
		describing the system.
		</p>
		<p>
		With the rise of the Google Books project in 2004, he began to focus upon the problems and 
		opportunities that arise when whole libraries rather than curated collections become available 
		on-line. The broad range of projects that he suppported with support from the DLI-2 program, 
		the Institute for Museum and Library Services, and the Mellon Foundation provided a broad 
		foundation within which to frame his current generation of research projects on Classical 
		Studies at Perseus. Crane overees the overall research program at Perseus.
		</p>
		<p>
		Crane is especially interested in helping the emerging Cyberinfrastructure serve the needs of 
		the humanities in general and classical studies in particular.
