onclick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/employment');">Research Programmer Analyst</a>: 
The Perseus Project at Tufts University seeks an individual to supervise the creation of a syntactic database for classical Greece 
with 1,000,000 words - one of the most promising instruments ever produced for the study of Greek linguistics, literary style, and 
lexicography. The editor is expected to supervise a team of annotators contributing analyses at various locations in Europe and 
North America. Ideally, the editor will, however, take advantage of this position to use this growing resource for his or her own 
research. We encourage graduate students who would consider building their dissertation work on this as well as classicists with PhD 
in hand. Suitable candidates will will have an opportunity to teach one course a semester.
