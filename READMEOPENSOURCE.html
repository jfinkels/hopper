<h1><b>The Perseus Digital Library 4.0</b></h1>
<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p>This package represents a Java reimplementation of much the older Perl Perseus Digital Library hopper web 
application. It does not aim to replicate every last bit of the Perl hopper&rsquo;s functionality, but instead 
concentrates on the features that were most commonly used: displaying of text and associated resources, 
searching, morphological analysis and statistical information, to name a few.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>If you want to generate all of the data yourself, please use INSTALLEVERYTHING.html. If you want to install 
the hopper with the provided database dumps and processed XML files, please use INSTALLWITHDATA.html. The 
hopper can only be installed on Linux and Mac OS X. It currently will not work on any Windows operating 
systems.</p>

<h2>Design Goals</h2>
<p>In designing this package, the following served as guidelines:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Keep everything in Java. This has various advantages. Operating system becomes more of a choice. 
  Installation is simpler &mdash; basically a matter of collecting JAR files.</li>
  <li>Move data from flat files to RDBMS. Much work has been put into making relational databases fast and 
  useful. Our data is inherently relational, so it can be most clearly organized and retrieved in table 
  format.</li>
  <li>Provide a clear API. The Perl hopper is an incredibly powerful tool for creating text processing 
  applications. But the amount of detailed, often confusing, knowledge required to program with it is 
  daunting. A combination of more modular object design and Java&rsquo;s self-documentation abilities should 
  make it much simpler to build novel applications from existing code.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Status</h2>
<p>The Java hopper began as a front-end replacement for the old hopper, using old files and databases to 
power a JSP-based web interface that aimed for a newer and generally &ldquo;cleaner&rdquo; look. Since then, more and 
more front-end and back-end features of the Perl system have been replicated in Java; as of now, the Java 
system can function entirely on its own.</p>
<p>At present, almost all the texts from the old hopper behave as expected in the new hopper. The exceptions 
are generally texts with interesting layouts and subdocument configurations, such as some of the 
commentaries. Also, the new hopper does not support the TEI&rsquo;s step-based citation schemes (these appear in 
only a few texts, such as Butler&rsquo;s <i>Iliad</i> translation).</p>
<p>There is still a great deal of work that could be done to replicate the Perl hopper&rsquo;s features, although 
it is not certain whether such work would be worth the effort; a great many specialized features, such as 
the the TLG and DDBDP searching tools and the Perseus Atlas, have not been reimplemented.</p>
<p>The Java hopper does include one piece of functionality not present in the Perl hopper: the named-entity 
browser, which provides several new mechanisms for browsing and searching places, people and dates in the 
collection.</p>

<h2>Java Dependencies and Supporting Technologies</h2>
<p>The Java hopper uses a host of third-party frameworks to simplify many of its tasks. To interact with 
the database, it initially used JDBC and raw SQL queries; most of these interactions have since been 
rewritten, along with the corresponding model objects, in Hibernate, an object-relational management 
(ORM) system. The front-end began its existence as a collection of JSP pages, and, while in large part 
it remains as such, most newer functionality is backed by the Spring framework and uses either FreeMarker 
or JSP templates with controller classes. Searching is handled by the Lucene library, and XML processing 
is handled by a great many libraries including Xalan, Xerces and JDOM. Ant serves as a build tool, and 
Tomcat (or an alternate servlet container) powers the front-end functionality.</p>
<p>Here follows a list of used third-party libraries, all of which are either included in the lib directory 
or readily downloadable. Note that this is <i>not</i> a comprehensive list; in particular, third-party 
libraries that need only be installed because another third-party library depends on them may not be listed 
here.</p>

<h2>A Tour of the <code>reading</code> Package</h2>
<p>The following is an attempt to explain the various directories that the Java hopper contains and their 
functionality. Note that this list ignores directories that are generated by the hopper in the course of 
loading data (e.g., the directories containing the Lucene indices and the Java class files), as they can 
theoretically go anywhere, depending on configuration.</p>

<h2><b>Weaknesses</b></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Although the Java rewrite was a great improvement on the Perl hopper, it has inherited some of the 
  Perl code&rsquo;s problems, thanks to its relying on old database tables for so long. In particular, the code 
  to handle texts with subdocuments is confusing and requires the relevant objects to be far more self-aware 
  than they should be.</li>
  <li>The current codebase is not very modular; the code for the back-end and the web application, and all 
  the support files, is currently compiled to a single JAR. Ideally, it would compile into several different 
  modules that could be substituted in and out as the system&rsquo;s needs dictated. In general, the separation 
  between display and content could be greatly improved&mdash;many of the JSP pages could be broken out into 
  controllers and view templates, which would make it far easier for other digital libraries to implement 
  a different interface based on the Perseus back-end.</li>
  <li>The Java rewrite required itself a prohibitive amount of rewriting as the developers gained more 
  familiarity with available third-party libraries. Much of the functionality began as raw SQL code embedded 
  within model objects and was rewritten over time in Hibernate, with Data Access Objects (DAOs) used to 
  separate the objects from the database code. This rewriting represented a great deal of time that could 
  have been used to add more features. Of course, none of the development staff could have been expected 
  to be acquainted with the full breadth of Java libraries, but more up-front planning and research would 
  have saved a great deal of time later on.</li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Some Known Issues</b></h2>
<ul>
  <li>When running the hopper, Tomcat tends to crash periodically with an OutOfMemoryError, at which point 
  it needs to be restarted. (It is not clear whether the fault is in the hopper, or in Spring, Hibernate or 
  the Java virtual machine; a Google search on the subject produces various forum discussions that establish 
  little for certain.)</li>
  <li>Tomcat&rsquo;s logs, if left unchecked, will keep growing and growing (in particular, the catalina.out file) 
  and may eventually need to be deleted to reclaim disk space. Much of this can probably be solved with some 
  tweaks to Tomcat&rsquo;s logging configuration.</li>
  <li>Some texts could not be released with the source code because they cannot be freely distributed. 
  However, these texts are always available on the <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/">Perseus website</a>.</li>
  <li>Certain chunks of texts are known to be very large.In most cases,a truncated form of the chunk is 
  shown with the option to view the entire chunk. However, some chunks are simply too large for the system 
  to handle and currently cannot be displayed. These include: </li>
